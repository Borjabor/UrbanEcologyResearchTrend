A Distinctive Shape of Cadastral Parcels Bordering the Młynówka River in Strzelce Wielkie,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00092bfbdc07431c984953cdc0e71d6a02cdb769,A. Bitner; U. Litwin; S. Bacior; Jarosław Taszakowski; K. Król; P. Basta,"Morphological analysis is a widely used method, applied in many scientific disciplines: ecology, biology, hydrology, geodesy and cartography, geology, medicine, and in urban geography. The term “morphology” has different meanings in different disciplines. In geodesy and cartography it means, generally speaking, studying the geometric properties of objects in space. In this research a digital cadastral map was submitted for analysis. This paper presents the morphological analysis of the structure created by the borders of cadastral parcels located in Strzelce Wielkie. In particular, the relationship between the perimeter and the area of the parcels bordering the Młynówka River flowing through the village was determined. The analysis indicates that a typical parcel situated on the Młynówka River has a significantly elongated shape similar to the shape of parcels located in urban areas. The calculated coefficient of parcel shape demonstrates that parcels bordering the river are seen as attractive and that the river bank is used in the most optimal way."
The value of social media wildlife sightings for elusive species monitoring: a population assessment of servals in a South African urban nature reserve,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001dd10b968cbb3ef419682e973e6ad4f59ec484,Kyle Smith; M. J. Somers,"
 Data sourced from social media platforms is an underutilised resource for wildlife research, especially in studying enigmatic species. This study evaluates the potential of such data to provide population and behavioural insights into an elusive species, the serval (Leptailurus serval), from Rietvlei Nature Reserve, an urban protected area in South Africa. We collected 153 visitor sightings of servals within the reserve from different online platforms spanning from June 2011 to August 2024, from which we identified 30 different individual servals, including three long-term residents. Analysis of these sightings revealed a stable serval population with evidence of reproduction within the reserve and migration through a permeable border fence. Behavioural information from the sightings, such as prey captured and habitat use, align with existing knowledge of serval ecology. Even though data sourced from passive contributions by the public generally falls short in terms of data quality and detail, this study demonstrates that a well-supported social media community can be a valuable source of behavioural and basic population data of elusive species in a specific protected area. This approach allows for cost-effective wildlife research that is beneficial to both wildlife management and the formulation of conservation strategies."

Where economic parity meets ecology: Neither biodiversity nor ecosystem integrity values relate to wealth in the context of a medium-sized Finnish city,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002223943614047cfbe9b081bddece032ad2b15b,Sini Rautjärvi; I. MacGregor‐Fors,"Ecological conditions are heavily influenced by human–environment interactions, which is why understanding the relationships between people and nature is crucial. While earlier studies have indicated a pattern of positive correlations between economic wealth and biodiversity in urban areas, there are some examples that suggest that such associations are more intricate than initially presumed. In this study, we aimed to assess whether such a relation holds in Lahti, a medium-sized city in southern Finland, considering two biodiversity proxies (i.e., bird and woody plant species richness) and the Urban Ecosystem Integrity Index (UEII) of the city. Our results show no clear relationship between economic wealth (average annual income per statistical area) reported for 2019 and the two assessed biodiversity proxies and the UEII. These findings shed new light on the “luxury effect” in urban areas and reveal the nature of such relationship in highly green cities embedded in economic parity scenarios."
“Heed the Mute Language of Nature”: An Ecosemiotic Approach to Urban Wildlife Photography as Translation of Solastalgia,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0022b2322aeb1c7e8cd2c017e5994bbc20aca317,Xany Jansen van Vuuren; Helen-Mary Cawood,"ABSTRACT This paper attempts to conceptualise urban wildlife photography as so-called intersemiotic translation by reconceptualising the photographer as a translator who acts as “a mediator in an experiential process that allows the recipient (viewer, listener, reader or participant) to re-create the sense […] of the source artefact for him or herself” (Bennett 2019, 3). By reframing the focus from an anthropocentric ethic to a biocentric ethic on the loss of place and belonging experienced by non-human animals in urban ecologies, in particular, this paper intends to explore the role of urban wildlife photography as translation of solastalgia in re-evaluating our current human values towards the natural world. Originally defined as “distress that is produced by environmental change impacting on people while they are directly connected to their home environment” (Albrecht et al. 2007, S95), solastalgia, it is argued in this paper, should be extended to include the experience of the non-human as well. Photography, it is argued here, is one way in which this experience can be critically depicted and translated to a human audience. By means of an interdisciplinary discussion between Translation Studies and Critical Theory (through Walter Benjamin and Bernard Stiegler), we attempt to provide an ecosemiotic exploration of the conceptual grounding of urban wildlife photography as intersemiotic translation."
Evaluation of Urban Space Livability in the Urban Area of Hefei Based on Production-Living-Ecological Space,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0026966aaf36e2d8dbc731484a994aac4f10cbdb,Zhang Quan; Huijuan Nie; Xiaoying Li,"Abstract: Building livable urban space is an important component of urban construction. The evaluation of urban space livability is of great significance for urban sustainable development. The study measured the level of urban spatial livability in the urban area of Hefei from the spatial perspective of production-living-ecological space (PLES), using spatial analysis methods, to provide new ideas for the construction of livable urban spatial and to promote the coordination of urban spatial elements and spatial optimization. Firstly, this study constructed the evaluation model for urban spatial livability from three perspectives: Comfortable living, convenient production and ecological health. Secondly, using the evaluation model for urban spatial livability, the global spatial autocorrelation analysis method and the coupling coordination degree model, the single factor differentiation of urban space livable potential, comprehensive livable degree and the coupling degree of PLES in the urban area of Hefei were analyzed, respectively. Finally, this study discusses the coordination of PLES elements of the urban space in Hefei urban area, and puts forward spatial optimization strategies. The results show three important aspects of this system. (1) In terms of the single-factor livability of living, production and ecology, there are significant differences in the spatial distribution characteristics of the livability of the Hefei urban area. There is a spatial clustering of living comfort areas in the center, a spreading of production convenience areas from the center to the periphery, and a scattering of ecological health areas around the perimeter. (2) The overall livability of the urban space in Hefei is high. In terms of space, it shows the characteristics of high in the middle and low around the periphery, and the high-value area of livability is mainly concentrated in the urban center. (3) The coupling coordination degree of PLES in the urban area of Hefei is high in the city center and low around the city. The coupling coordination degree of life-production is the highest, which indicates that the spatial layout of these two elements has certain rationality and achieves benign coordination."
Research on Landscape Design of Mining Parks under the Perspective of Ecological Concepts,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002eef925c8e8ccac1446fa61a830b9baa93e87a,Zhou Jia; Kim Soo-bong,": Mining parks have gradually attracted widespread attention as a special type of urban green space. These parks are usually built in former mining areas, where abandoned mines are re-planned and transformed into places for public recreation, entertainment and education. The landscape design of mine parks presents unique challenges and opportunities, as it requires the integration of nature restoration, cultural preservation, ecological sustainability, and urban planning. This study aims to explore how mine parks can be designed and planned under an ecological conceptual perspective to achieve sustainable transformation of mining areas and improve the quality of urban environments. Mining areas were once centers of resource extraction, but over time many mines have been abandoned, leaving a large ecological imprint. In order to reintegrate these areas into natural ecosystems, the concept of mine parks was born. With the growing importance of ecological protection and sustainable development, the concept of ecology has become one of the core principles in the field of landscape design. Landscape design for mine parks is no exception to the need to incorporate ecological concepts in order to create landscapes that are environmentally friendly, sustainable and socially meaningful."

A Descriptive Study on the Phenotypic Variability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Identified by MALDI-TOF,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005e169e4d78efaff1beeead9cd2bc9363ecbc77,Tetty Aya Marie Pascale; Konan Fernique; Kady Ouattara; Y. Eric; V. Sabine; C. Julien,"This descriptive study investigates the phenotypic variability of 50 Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonies isolated from wastewater, identified using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The contamination of wastewater by opportunistic pathogens like P. aeruginosa poses significant public health risks due to their potential to cause severe infections and contribute to the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is particularly concerning because of its remarkable adaptability, resilience, and intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance mechanisms, including the production of beta-lactamases, efflux pumps, and target site mutations. Our study highlights the phenotypic diversity and antibiotic resistance profiles of P. aeruginosa strains isolated from urban and hospital environments. Using MALDI-TOF MS, we rapidly and accurately characterized these strains, providing species-level identification within minutes. This technology surpasses traditional biochemical methods in speed and accuracy, revolutionizing microbial diagnostics by offering a high-throughput, cost-effective, and reliable tool. By analyzing the phenotypic traits and resistance mechanisms of these strains, we aim to provide critical insights into their ecology and inform strategies to mitigate the risks associated with their presence in the environment. The antibiotic resistance profiles revealed varied susceptibility among the strains, with notable resistance to drugs such as erythromycin, cefoxitin, and tetracycline. The study's findings underscore the importance of integrating advanced diagnostic technologies like MALDI-TOF MS into routine environmental monitoring and public health strategies to address the challenges posed by P. aeruginosa in wastewater. Ultimately, this research contributes to understanding the dynamics of contamination and resistance in urban environments. By detailing the methodology used for the identification and characterization of the strains, as well as the results obtained, this publication aims to provide a valuable database for researchers and practitioners engaged in combating nosocomial infections and environmental pollution by P. aeruginosa. This study highlights the need for effective management measures to control the dissemination of this pathogen in aquatic systems, promoting public health and environmental safety."

Camarillo; Sara Thurmond,"The University of Houston-Victoria (U of H-V) is a small, public Hispanic Serving Institution in southeast Texas. Originally established as a teaching center for upper division and graduate students in 1974, U of H-V achieved “downward expansion” in 2010, a term used to refer to the expansion of the university s offerings to include freshmen and sophomores at the university. This expansion also reconfigured the student body, making it more urban, young, and diverse. As an example, in the fall of 2018, U of H-V enrolled 3,237 undergraduate students, 42 of whom identified as Hispanic, with 32 representing the first generation in their family to attend college. This student population increasingly re ects the demographics of the local area, where the population is over 50 minority, and approximately 50 Hispanic. In addition to diversifying the student body, downward expansion also resulted in enrolling more students who need extra support in order to succeed in a college environment, particularly in first-year math and English courses. Our institution s most recent efforts to provide this support forms the basis of this article, namely the unique version of corequisite support that emerged at our institution, as an organic outgrowth of our specific history, combined with a statewide mandate to create corequisites. Certainly, as we explain, the passage of state legislation helped provide the impetus for our move toward corequisites. Yet we were also motivated to re-assess our developmental curriculum, even without the new legislation, based on our own frustrations with the previous iteration of developmental classes. We knew (and know) our students need help with ge ng through their gateway courses but also finding an effective form for that assistance has been a challenge. We will brie y describe our previous efforts at providing that support before explicating our rationale for the current program. As we discuss in more detail in the course of this article, our response to the recent mandate to create a corequisite combined the purpose of the corequisite with our institution s first-year seminar; we created a few special sections of the first-year seminar designed especially for students designated as TSI-incomplete in one or more subject areas, each section of which supports a specific gateway course. Our idea was that the mission of the first-year seminar, to orient students to life at the university, could itself be advanced by making it more academic for these students, or more clearly contextualized with explicit links to academic work. In order to achieve this, we believed that corequisite remediation could be meaningfully accomplished in the first-year seminar. To achieve this mashup of the first-year seminar and corequisite, we initiated an otherwise unlooked-for collaboration between academic faculty and student support services staff, and we found that this cross-pollination between divisions of our institution also offered another payoff: it had the potential to extend and strengthen institutional safety-nets meant to support students underprepared for college. We find that remediation for underprepared students happens not only in academic content classes, but as part of a larger pedagogical ecology, or as one researcher describes it, a constellation of people, programs, initiatives, opportunities, constraints, and cultures that emerge and interact within a specific university context (Schoen, 2019, p. 38).

Guts of the Urban Ecosystem: Microbial Ecology of Sewer Infrastructure,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/008c85ad39722e8dad95951dbd577d079955772d,A. Roguet; Ryan J. Newton; A. M. Eren; S. McLellan,"Sewer infrastructure is a relatively new habitat comprised of thousands of kilometers of pipes beneath cities. These wastewater conveyance systems contain large reservoirs of microbial biomass with a wide range of metabolic potential and are significant reservoirs of antibiotic resistant organisms; however, we lack an adequate understanding of the ecology or activity of these communities beyond wastewater treatment plants. ABSTRACT Microbes have inhabited the oceans and soils for millions of years and are uniquely adapted to their habitat. In contrast, sewer infrastructure in modern cities dates back only ~150 years. Sewer pipes transport human waste and provide a view into public health, but the resident organisms that likely modulate these features are relatively unexplored. Here, we show that the bacterial assemblages sequenced from untreated wastewater in 71 U.S. cities were highly coherent at a fine sequence level, suggesting that urban infrastructure separated by great spatial distances can give rise to strikingly similar communities. Within the overall microbial community structure, temperature had a discernible impact on the distribution patterns of closely related amplicon sequence variants, resulting in warm and cold ecotypes. Two bacterial genera were dominant in most cities regardless of their size or geographic location; on average, Arcobacter accounted for 11% and Acinetobacter 10% of the entire community. Metagenomic analysis of six cities revealed these highly abundant resident organisms carry clinically important antibiotic resistant genes blaCTX-M, blaOXA, and blaTEM. In contrast, human fecal bacteria account for only ~13% of the community; therefore, antibiotic resistance gene inputs from human sources to the sewer system could be comparatively small, which will impact measurement capabilities when monitoring human populations using wastewater. With growing awareness of the metabolic potential of microbes within these vast networks of pipes and the ability to examine the health of human populations, it is timely to increase our understanding of the ecology of these systems. IMPORTANCE Sewer infrastructure is a relatively new habitat comprised of thousands of kilometers of pipes beneath cities. These wastewater conveyance systems contain large reservoirs of microbial biomass with a wide range of metabolic potential and are significant reservoirs of antibiotic resistant organisms; however, we lack an adequate understanding of the ecology or activity of these communities beyond wastewater treatment plants. The striking coherence of the sewer microbiome across the United States demonstrates that the sewer environment is highly selective for a particular microbial community composition. Therefore, results from more in-depth studies or proven engineering controls in one system could be extrapolated more broadly. Understanding the complex ecology of sewer infrastructure is critical for not only improving our ability to treat human waste and increasing the sustainability of our cities but also to create scalable and effective sewage microbial observatories, which are inevitable investments of the future to monitor health in human populations."
"Patches, Corridors, Matrix, Webs and Clouds. Expanding Richard TT Forman’s Land Mosaic Approach in the Medina of Tunis",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/008fa300dfcd1919382cae7c56d1c434c8dc627d,Gareth Doherty; Areti Kotsoni,"This study proposes a framework for analyzing the medina of Tunis, based on Richard T.T. Forman's theory of land mosaics. Departing from traditional preservationist methods, it views the Medina as a multifaceted landscape, integrating both tangible and intangible elements. Drawing from Félix Guattari’s concept of the three ecologies, the paper expands upon Forman’s model by introducing two additional categories: webs and clouds, to encompass the social and subjective aspects of the landscape. Through a literature review and landscape fieldwork, the study advocates for an integrative approach to analyzing the medina's physical and intangible components. The resulting framework offers a landscape analysis tool applicable to other urban landscapes, moving beyond the taxidermy of urban/cultural conservation practices and considering marginalized communities affected by capitalism-driven heritage management and tourism. Such a perspective is integral in promoting social and ecological inclusivity and embedding sustainable practices, particularly in response to the pressing challenges of climate change. Ultimately, this approach would help the contemporary landscape project succeed in “grounding new narratives and topologies” of “re-signification” of other historic urban areas and medinas across North Africa."

The aim of the National Science Foundation–funded Big Data Project at CSULA was to engage students and faculty in using big data to tackle social issues such as racial violence, poverty, environmental inequalities, urban ecology, and structural barriers in Los Angeles, while preserving the cultural richness of the communities in East Los Angeles and surrounding areas. Once a year, faculty members applied to the program to incorporate data projects into their courses, received training, adapted their curricula, and worked with nonprofits. Our experience showed that the students who participated in this semester-long, hands-on learning experience exceeded the learning objectives of the program and specific courses. They were key contributors in generating new insights using big data, fostering meaningful dialogue, and creating research and scholarship opportunities that positively impacted their communities."
Wildfires in Australia: a bibliometric analysis and a glimpse on ‘Black Summer’ (2019/2020) disaster,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00935188ebe096c2932594544910a2bff0e6012c,K. Haque; M.

Rahman,"A wildfire, an unplanned fire that is mainly uncontrolled and originates in combustible vegetation in rural or urban settings, is one of the most pervasive natural catastrophes in some areas, such as Siberia, California and Australia. Many studies, such as standard reviews, have been undertaken to look into the works of literature on wildfires or forest fires and their effects on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Regrettably, conventional literature reviews failed to identify the important researchers, evolving complexities, emerging research hotspots, trends and opportunities for further research on the ground of wildfire study. The present study employs bibliometric analysis to investigate this study area qualitatively and quantitatively. The Scopus database systems and Web of Science Core Collection yielded 78 qualifying papers, which were then evaluated using Biblioshiny (A bibliometrix tool of R-studio). According to the statistics, the discipline is expanding at a pace that is 13.68% faster than average. So far, three key periods of transformation have been documented: preliminary evolution (8 articles; 1999–2005), gentle evolution (14 articles; 2006–2013) and quick evolution (56 articles; 2014 to 2021). Forest Ecology and Management and Science journals have the highest number of publications, accounting for 7.70% of total wildfire-related articles published from 1999 to 2021. However, recent data indicate that investigators are shifting their focus to wildfires, with the term ‘Australia’ having the highest frequency (91) and ‘wildfire’ having the second highest (58) as the most appeared keywords. The present study will provide a foundation for future research on wildfire incidence and management by receiving information by synthesising previously published literature in Australia and around the world."

Murray Schafer and the World Soundscape Project studied everyday soundscapes and the rise of urban noise. While it was an innovative approach to understanding the relationship between humans and their environments, it reproduced the dominant frameworks of this period. Analysis: This article argues that contemporary acoustic ecology discourse continues to frame noise, silence, and urban acoustic design through a white normative and colour-blind listening framework. This article examines dominant authorship and citation practices within leading journals that publish soundscape literature as well as sound mapping practices. Conclusion: After also surveying seldom-cited soundscape research that interrogates the environmental listening and sound-making practices of BIPOC and marginalized communities, the article concludes that there is a need for contemporary soundscape research to incorporate more intersectional and decolonial modes of environmental listening."

Pan,"The epidemic has once again made urban resilience a core argument for responding urban crises while ensuring urban safety. As an important research field of design ecology, resilience make contributes to build a healthier and sustainable city, which urgently need further research and development. This paper takes 11896 literature retrieved from the Web of Science TM core collection database and 629 literature retrieved from CNKI from 2006 to 2021 as the research object. Using CiteSpace scientific knowledge visualization software, combined with literature content analysis and interpretation, this paper sorts out the general situation of its development then identifies research hot spot and frontier. Results show that:(1)the previous studies mainly focus on resilient cities, sponge cities, stormwater management, resilient landscapes, sustainable design and blue-green infrastructure; (2) the frontier of resilience research in design ecology is: climate change, community resilience, disaster response, risk assessment, etc. In addition, compared with foreign scientific research orientation, domestic research mainly focuses on practical applications in planning and design, lacking systematic theoretical and technical research support. In conclusion, points out the shortage of resilience research and how to put forward the future research. Finally, it meets the needs of building resilient cities in the 14th Five-Year Plan, providing guidance and method reference for the follow-up researches of resilience."

In this paper, we look at the varying trajectory of landscape change in two neighboring villages in Mount Lebanon with similar geophysical characteristics but very different ecologies and economies. We show how these paths were mediated by capital flows and the changing modes of production and livelihoods. Looking through the lens of the Agrarian Question, we argue for its continued importance in understanding rural landscapes and their place in capitalist development."

A comprehensive multi-state conditional occupancy model for evaluating interactions of non-native and native species,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0136064985918625fce953a973d2465833c77a7a,Patti J. Wohner; P. Scheerer; M. H. Meeuwig; James T. Peterson,"A major challenge in ecology is disentangling interactions of non-native, potentially invasive species on native species. Conditional two-species occupancy models examine the effects of dominant species (e.g., non-native) on subordinate species (e.g., native) while considering the possibility that occupancy of one species may affect occupancy and/ or detection of the other. Although conditional two-species models are useful for evaluating the influence of one species on presence of another, it is possible that species interactions are density dependent. Therefore, we developed a novel two-species occupancy model that incorporates multiple abundance states (i.e., absent, present, abundant) of the native species. We showcase the utility of this model with a case study that incorporates random effects and covariates on both occupancy and detection to help disentangle species interactions given varying occupancy and detection in different abundance states. We use snorkel survey data from the Umpqua basin, Oregon, where it is hypothesized that smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, a non-native piscivore, exclude Umpqua chub Oregonichthys kalawatseti, a small endemic minnow. From our two-species multi-state (2SMS) model, we concluded that average occupancy was low for both fishes, and that when non-native bass were present, overall native chub occupancy in the present (0.18 ± 0.05 SD) and abundant (0.19 ± 0.03) states was higher than when non-natives were absent (0.14 ± 0.02/ 0.08 ± 0.02), indicating the non-native was not excluding the native species. By incorporating a species interaction factor, we found a positive association (6.75 ± 5.54 SD) between native chub and non-native bass. The covariates strongly related to occupancy were elevation, algae, and land cover type (urban and shrub). Detection probability for both species (0.21–0.82) was most strongly related to the covariates day of year, water temperature, gravel substrate, and stream order/ magnitude. Incorporation of detection probability and covariates enabled interpretation of interactions between the two species that may have been missed without their inclusion in the modeling process. Our new 2SMS occupancy model can be used by scientists and managers with a broad range of survey and covariate data to disentangle species interactions problems to help them inform management decisions."
Visual Analysis of Landscape Aesthetic Evaluation Based on Bibliometric Methods,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01517c961c3671c35fe18eeabd9809c4eadb8cb9,Qiang Wang; Mingyuan Zhao; Lan-yong Zhao,"In recent decades, landscape aesthetic evaluation has been one of the research hotspots in the field of Landscape Science and Ecology, and Landscape Science, Ecology and other related disciplines have been integrated at multiple levels in the research. In order to sort out and summarize the research process and results in the past decade, with a view to find future research trends, we retrieved and downloaded papers on landscape aesthetic evaluation from the WOS database and analyzed them using a bibliometric method based on mathematical statistics. We used Excel to perform a basic analysis of the growth trends in the number of articles, source journals and countries. Co-citation analysis, Cluster analysis, and Keyword co-occurrence analysis were performed with Citespace, and visual graphs were generated. Based on the combing of landscape aesthetic evaluation research, we analyzed and discussed the research frontier and its evolution, key literature and research hotspots, development trend and knowledge structure in this field, and conclude that: (1) the research in the field in recent decade can be divided into the period of theoretical foundation construction, research system improvement and diversified development, (2) Research methods have developed from mainly evaluating landscape photos to the comprehensive use of GIS, VR, Eye-tracking, EEG testing and other technological means, and (3) research hotspots have expanded from Ecology, Scenic beauty evaluation and Landscape management to Rural landscape, Urban public space and Land use, representing the future development trend."

Optimized the ecological network by edge-adding of the complex network theory, compared the optimizing effects of different edge-adding strategies by using robustness analysis, and put forward an effective way to optimize the ecological network of the study area. The results demonstrate that: The ecological patches of Daowai, Xiangfang, Nangang, and other old districts in the study area are small in size, fewer in number, strongly fragmented, with a single external morphology, and high internal porosity. While the ecological patches in the new districts of Songbei, Hulan, and Acheng have a relatively good foundation. And ecological network connectivity in the study area is generally poor, the ecological corridors are relatively sparse and scattered, the connections between various ecological sources of the corridors are not close. Comparing different edge-adding strategies of complex network theory, the low-degree-first strategy has the most outstanding performance in the robustness test. The low-degree-first strategy was used to optimize the ecological network of the study area, 43 ecological corridors are added. After the optimization, the large and the small ecological corridors are evenly distributed to form a complete network, the optimized ecological network will be significantly more connected, resilient, and resistant to interference, the ecological flow transmission will be more efficient."

Livelihoods with multiple stressors: Gendered youth decision-making under global change in rural Northwest Mexico,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/017172fb7f458ab7e6e51156ffbf59cb3c7cd8c7,S. Buechler; América N. Lutz-Ley,"Livelihoods in rural communities have become increasingly complex due to rapidly changing socio-economic and environmental forces, with differing impacts on and responses by female and male youth. This study contributes to feminist political ecology through an explicit focus on youth and an examination of the intersections of age and gender in educational choices, livelihood systems, and human–environment interactions. We undertake double exposures analysis to explore female and male youths’ livelihood-related decision-making in Rayón, a semi-arid rural community in Northwest Mexico, undergoing global environmental change and globalization-related shifts in agriculture, climate, water, and socio-economic conditions. Global environmental change exacerbates an already fragile, local ecological context. A focus on gender issues among youth in three age categories (14–15, 16–19, and youth in their 20s) with respect to their decision-making concerning the future is critical to gaining a better understanding of the roles women and men will play in linked agricultural and non-agricultural, rural to urban livelihood systems. Agricultural employment increasingly includes global agribusiness where local youth compete with people from other areas. Access to employment, education, as well as water and land resources varied by gender, age, and social class, and played significant roles in livelihood diversification and migration decisions and outcomes. Mothers’ access to government assistance for their natural resource-based livelihoods positively impacted daughters’ opportunities. Educational curricula failed to link environmental change with local livelihoods and to prepare students for urban careers. This study offers insights related to female and male youths’ needs associated with environmental education, technology access, job training, and child and sibling care in order for them to more successfully confront the future across village, town, and city spaces."
Comprehensive Evaluation of Water Ecological Civilization Based on Random Forest Regression Algorithm,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01723d7ce06eca74afbb2566dc840c3c8e4910e2,Xin Jin; Yiheng Yao,"With the continuous development of China's social economy and the progress of human civilization, people's requirements for the natural and social environment they live in are getting higher and higher. The study of comprehensive evaluation of water ecological civilization (WEC) accelerates the implementation of water resources management system and creates huge ecological and environmental benefits for society. The random forest regression algorithm (RFRA) is applied to the study of comprehensive evaluation of WEC in China, which is of great significance to the construction of urban WEC in China. The purpose of this paper is to conduct research on the comprehensive evaluation of WEC based on RFRA. In this paper, we use the Gini index prediction of random forest algorithm to find out the factors affecting the evaluation of WEC, and rank the importance of these influencing factors, so as to provide scientific decision-making basis and improvement suggestions for the effective protection of WEC. This paper uses random generation method, comprehensive index method, multi-indicator comprehensive evaluation method and literature method to construct training samples and test samples between the standard thresholds of WEC evaluation level and establish evaluation models. The experimental results show that this paper analyzes the change trend of each domain layer index over time and the difference of different domain layer indexes at the same time, and finds that the growth rate is more than 10%, and ESDL is obviously better than EEC, which indicates that the quality of WEC management and water ecological environment has been improved, as well as the pressure caused by population growth on the water system has been relieved, but the construction of WEC is still unsatisfactory, and needs to increase the efforts of water ecology restoration."
Speculative Political Ecologies: (re)imagining urban futures of climate extremes,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/018bfb8d345c7b3c2ddde0979469153cf7698b27,Maria Rusca; M. Mazzoleni; Alejandro Barcena; Alejandro Barcena; Elisa Savelli; G. Messori,"What role can a speculative political ecology play in (re)imaging urban futures of climate extremes? In recent years, narratives of dystopian futures of climate extremes have proliferated in geosciences, and across the media and creative arts. These anxiety-fueled narratives often generate a sense of resignation and unavoidability, which contributes to foreclosing the possibility of radically different political projects. In this article, we argue that these narratives conceal the coproduction of nature and society and treat nature as the problem, thereby locking futures into dystopic configurations. Political ecology scholarship can contribute to generate a politics of possibility by reconceptualizing the relations that constitute urban futures under climate extremes as socionatural. This, we argue, calls for a more experimental political ecology and new forms of theorizing. To this aim, we develop a speculative political ecological approach grounded on a numerical model that examines the potential of transformative change in the aftermath of extreme flood events in a capitalist city. Analytically, this opens a unique possibility of exploring urban futures beyond current trajectories, and how these alternative futures might transform vulnerability and inequality across urban spaces. From a policy perspective, we lay the foundations for a new generation of models that apprehend the role of power and agency in shaping uneven urban futures of climate extremes."
Life-Long Education for Sustainable and Green Economy: Adopting Innovative Technologies for Better Health and Quality of Life,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01912e723c07c77c6fba5c7e7d761669bfbb506d,Prof. Dr Jan W. Dobrowolski,"In this paper it has been proposed that there is a requirement of a foundation for International Network of Experts in New Transdisciplinary Areas of Biomimetic Green Chemistry (Environmental Biotechnology integrated with Human Ecology, Biological and Chemical Sciences). These would play a key role for the success of such human-oriented missions supported by experts in material engineering, architecture, IT and many complementary research fields, contributing to optimization of new inventions and discoveries. I would like to introduce a working hypothesis that will be starting point for solving these crucial problems. The next step would be optimization of sustainable design of innovative constructions as result of cooperation of experts in architecture, mathematical modeling and IT. The next step of this mission would be supplementation of new constructions resistant to strong earth-quakes, more and more common winds due to climate change that would include development of living houses with life support systems (a bit similar to circular green chemistry recommended for long-term manned outer-space missions).

We have to collect complementary achievements in biotechnology-based circular wastewater treatment and reuse them for adaptation to climate change as well as waste bio-management. This can yield bio-fuel and bio-energies useful for optimal climate conditions, for production of pollutant-free food, vegetables, mushrooms, algae, aquaculture products, fishes and their breeding. Such new concepts of underground centers. integrating modern environmental biotechnology with large-scale production of food for inhabitants of big cities – may be a significant contribution to urban agriculture in different regions of the world. Proposed solutions would be also useful all over the world for better adaptation to climate change, in particular for prevention of infections during periods of epidemics, and for sustainable labor market related to bioeconomy-driven over all sustainable development."
Revisiting Cifuentes’s Model for Cultural Heritage Tourism in the Era of Pandemics: The Site of Mardin Cultural Landscape Area,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01937000d887ad7d11b546efe4ca34bd88d98702,A. Erdoğan,"ABSTRACT The sustainability of tourism areas requires visitor management complying with their carrying capacities. By focusing on culture, this study revisits Cifuentes’s model developed for determining tourist load capacity within the field of ecology and used widely in natural protection areas. Theoretically, from within the field of urban planning, it contributes with adaptation of this model into a mere cultural heritage site. Practically, it creates scientific bases for visitor management of the area of Site Management Plan for Artuklu (Mardin) considering the limitations of the pandemic. First, the study area covering the site of “Mardin Cultural Landscape” and its environs was divided into different Visitor Management Zones (VMZs) by following opportunity spectrum approaches. VMZs, characterized by high, medium, low tourist densities, were determined by evaluating the findings of MCDA. Secondly, physical (PCC), real (RCC), and effective (ECC) carrying capacities adapted from model were calculated for each VMZ. The findings indicated a high level of difference between the PCC and RCC and much higher difference with that of ECC. The RCCs and ECCs signified that unless resolving basic infrastructure problems besides inefficiencies of personnel employment for the proper management of the site, it is not possible for it to welcome new visitors."

ESTIMATION OF SUMMER SURFACE URBAN HEAT ISLAND OF NOVOSIBIRSK FROM LANDSAT 8 SATELLITE IMAGES,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01b0eeeadb744ea71722571da84a51aa5110a7de,T. F. Gazimov; I. Kuzhevskaya,"An urban heat island is a phenomenon which occurs when the temperature in urban areas is higher than that in their rural surroundings. The formation of an urban heat island has a negative impact on the health of urban dwellers and the ecology of the city. We assessed the intensity of the surface urban heat island (UHISurf) in the city of Novosibirsk during the summer period from 2018 to 2020 using two categories of indicators – those based solely on differences in temperature (UHI-driven) and those including land cover type data (land-cover-driven). Data from the Landsat 8 were used to obtain information on land surface temperature. In accordance with the chosen methodology, bands 4, 5 and 10 were taken to calculate the land surface temperature. A prerequisite for satellite data selection was the absence of cloud cover over the study area. In this paper, nine buffers with a diameter of 1 km were selected, each around ground-based meteorological observation points at the Roshydromet network of stations. The results obtained indicate the presence of a stable surface urban heat island in Novosibirsk during the study period. The maximum value among all surface urban heat island intensity indicators was 23,0°C for the range indicator. Negative intensity values (up to –1,6°C) were also obtained for several cases, which is associated with a larger heating of croplands relative to urban surfaces. It is concluded that UHISurf intensity values depend on the choice of the calculation approach."
Between the colossal and the catastrophic: Planetary urbanization and the political ecologies of emergent infectious disease,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01b7d4625f9527a3a14b1ae2891c326ffed0ce7a,N. Brenner; Swarnabh Ghosh,"Against the backdrop of contemporary debates on the transcendence of city-centric epistemologies in urban theory, this article proposes a theoretical framework for exploring the connections between processes of planetary urbanization and the political ecologies of emergent infectious disease. Following a brief overview of research on cities and the coronavirus pandemic, we elaborate a critical interrogation and heterodox synthesis of two distinct lines of investigation—(1) research by Roger Keil and his collaborators on the embeddedness of emergent infectious diseases within processes of extended urbanization and (2) work by radical epidemiologist Rob Wallace and his colleagues, which productively situates emergent infectious diseases in relation to the geographies and political ecologies of agribusiness under neoliberalizing capitalism. We direct attention to the ways in which processes of planetary urbanization are remaking the human and nonhuman geographies of non-city spaces, causing infectious pathogens to be unmoored from previously localized ecosystems and catapulted into broader territories of circulation. This line of analysis requires rigorous application of dialectical methods that can illuminate the internal relations through which cities dynamically co-evolve and co-transform with the non-city spaces, more-than-human territories, and multispecies political ecologies that support their metabolic operations, including at the microbiological scale of novel pathogens. The elaboration of such an approach yields an interpretation of the urbanization/emergent infectious disease nexus as a medium and expression of the agro-ecological crisis tendencies of neoliberal capitalism. A concluding section outlines three emergent arenas of agro-industrial transformation in which processes of extended urbanization have created new spatial configurations and infrastructural pathways for the production and proliferation of emergent infectious diseases."
Influence of Atmospheric Non-Uniform Saturation on Extreme Hourly Precipitation Cloud Microphysical Processes in a Heavy Rainfall Case in Zhengzhou,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01bc6ab1f3a81748e89f84f89cb0d56e020c3659,Jin Xu; Liren Xu; Yufei Wang; Fan Ping; Lei Yin,"Heavy rainfall not only affects urban infrastructure, it also impacts environmental changes, and which then influence the sustainability of development and ecology. Therefore, researching and forecasting heavy rainfall to prevent disaster-related damages is essential. A high-resolution numerical simulation was carried out for a heavy rainfall case in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China, from 19–20 July 2021. The analysis of weather conditions revealed that the main cause of heavy rainfall in Zhengzhou was the supersaturation and condensation of water vapor, resulting from the invasion of dry and cold air from the upper and middle atmospheric layers. This weather condition is ideally suited for applying generalized potential temperature that is informed by the non-uniform saturation theory. Based on this, the new scheme revised the cloud microphysical scheme of the cloud water condensation parameterization process by substituting generalized potential temperature. The characteristics of the mesoscale environment and water condensates were comparatively analyzed between the original and the new scheme. Then, the quantitative mass budget and latent heat budget related to microphysical conversions were comparatively calculated over Zhengzhou. Furthermore, the possible two-scheme mechanisms through which the cloud microphysics processes affected the rainfall were investigated and discussed. It was found that: (1) The new scheme, which takes into account generalized potential temperature, produced precipitation fields more in line with observations and simulated stronger hourly precipitation compared to the original scheme. (2) The conversions of snow were the main source of microphysical processes that produced precipitation and released latent heat due to the dry and cold air invasion. (3) Given that the condensation of water vapor was hypothesized to occur at 70% relative humidity (RH) or above, rather than the original 100% RH, the new scheme simulated more supercooled water and ice-phase particles than the original scheme. This enhancement, in turn, intensified convective development owing to positive feedback within the cloud microphysics processes and cloud environment, ultimately leading to the simulation of more intense hourly precipitation."
An integrated approach using multi-source data for effective pollution risk monitoring of urban rivers: a case study of Hangzhou.,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01d13e8ec8b06238413cc39dd2f99bfd3a539261,Hao Wu; Qianhu Chen,"With the rapid urbanization of cities, water pollution has emerged as a major challenge to their sustainable development. To tackle this problem, we developed a river pollution risk management system that integrates multi-source data and includes risk identification, early warning, and control. We applied this system to a case study of urban rivers in Hangzhou, China. The results indicated that the measured and effect values of urban river water quality in Hangzhou were 1.01 and 1.14, respectively, indicating mild pollution levels. NH3-N is the main risk factor, with poor supervision and land use being the main risk sources. River pollution risk in different drainage zones demonstrated stratification. Since 2012, the measured risk of water quality in Hangzhou has been decreasing, mainly concentrated in the built-up area; however, the effect risk has been increasing, especially in the new center and sub-center of the city. Based on these findings, three strategies for urban river pollution control are suggested: water ecology source rehabilitation, water environment process supervision, and water pollution end management. The results of this study extend the understanding of urban water environment risk and provide implications for sustainable urban planning."
Comparative Analysis of Heat Resistance of Ornamental Urban Plants in Kyiv,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01f44ccae16889d8ba57cbcb68e70fdb0619f809,Oleksandra Strashok,"Urban plants play a significant role in shaping the microclimate of the modern city, in addition to the recreational and aesthetic functions. Climate change and sharp changes in temperature affect the plant growth and development, so the question of studying the adaptive potential of the plant range in cities to temperature variability is relevant and important. Researchers and scientists around the world are studying the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on plants, but the variability of the plant organisms in the urban ecosystem is still unexplored. The data from the analysis of the frequency of occurrence plants in Kyiv green spaces show that Tilia cordata Mill., Aesculus hippocastanum L., Spiraea×vanhouttei (Briot) Zabel. and Carpinus betulus L. are most represented among the researched species. The article presents the results of the assessment of heat resistance by using the method of Matskov (1976) of 13 ornamental woody and shrubby species. Besides, the plants were separated into groups of tolerance to high temperatures. It was established that the T. cordata plants are characterized by the highest indicators of heat tolerance and they can be recommended for the creation of open landscapes. The A. hippocastanum, Catalpa bignonioides Walt., S. vanhouttei and Forsythia europaea Degen & Bald. plants are characterized by ‘moderate tolerance’ indicators to high temperature stress, therefore they can be recommended for the creation of semi-open/open landscape types. Consequently, for the formation of semi-open landscapes, using the species Platanus occidentalis L., Quercus robur L., Q. rubra, Syringa vulgaris L., Berberis thunbergii DC. and Ligustrum vulgare L. which were assessed as ‘moderately sensitive’, is recommended. The leaves of the Carpinus betulus L. and Ribes aureum Pursh. plants were most vulnerable to high temperature stress; therefore, the species are recommended for the formation of closed landscape types. Despite the comparative classification of ornamental plants in terms of heat-resistance, many issues remain unstudied and need to be clarified in terms of ecology, physiology, biochemistry and phytopathology for the plants of urban green spaces."

Believing in South Central: Everyday Islam in the City of Angels,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02201ac8d7265e82dbea9f0fb0924e70789b5477,K. Moore,"In Believing in South Central: Everyday Islam in the City of Angels, Pamela Prickett offers a rich ethnographic account of Muslims attending a neighborhood mosque located in a predominantly African American community south of downtown Los Angeles. Based on extensive participant-observation over five years (2008 to 2013), Prickett explores the efforts of many of her interlocutors to live Islam in an urban environment that has witnessed significant change. The book begins by addressing the growth and decline of the mosque—Masjid al-Quran (MAQ)—which, in its heyday, hosted activities that attracted Black entertainment and sports celebrities as well as the first African American mayor of Los Angeles, Tom Bradley, to visit. Located in one of the poorest and most blighted areas of Los Angeles, MAQ was founded in the 1950s as a Nation of Islam temple. For this community of believers, the 1962 LAPD shooting of an unarmed African American Muslim man outside another NOI temple was a defining moment and illustrates that police violence and surveillance are nothing new for African American Muslims. Drawing on interviews with current MAQ members, Prickett recounts how this African American Muslim community concentrated on growing their economic base in Los Angeles during the 1960s and 1970s by running businesses, teaching children, cooking food, importing fish, and selling newspapers on the street. In fact, the community experienced so much growth in the early 1970s that it needed more space, so they purchased a nearby building and converted the commercial property into a religious and educational facility. The community witnessed profound changes to its theological foundations and suffered financial setbacks following the 1975 death of NOI leader, Elijah Mohammed; and an existing schism widened between members who were modestly prospering and those who remained poor. Several of the more prosperous members of MAQ moved out to the suburbs, and poverty rates soared as the local economy shifted to the service sector. During the 1980s, drugand gang-related crime swept over South Central LA, coinciding with a dramatic demographic shift as new migrants from Central America moved in. Those who had moved out to wealthier neighborhoods often joined newer mosques in other neighborhoods, and MAQ was depleted of resources. By the early 2010s, when Prickett conducted her fieldwork, many of the formerly Muslim-owned enterprises catered to a growing Latinx population. Prickett sums up the impact: ‘‘MAQ faced the challenges of sustaining its Muslim, historically Black community in a religious ecology that increasingly favored Latino Christian denominations’’ (p. 57). Through an inquiry into her interlocutors’ stories of economic instability and community life, Prickett skillfully shows how the believers turned Islam into a ‘‘toolkit’’ that incorporated their lived reality into constructions of piety in a neighborhood of changing demographics and disadvantage. The book joins key sociological and ethnographic debates on identity, self, and agency that have been kindled by discussions of women’s piety in Islamicate contexts. One of the book’s most significant contributions is its emphasis not on individual subject formation and embodied religious practices, but on how believers construct a moral community and cultivate virtues ‘‘that must be achieved through engagement with others’’ (p. 3). As a ‘‘piety not independent of others’’ (p. 4), the author argues that collective community formation is just as much a form of taqwa—defined here as religious consciousness—as individual acts such as prayer. The believers of MAQ could no more discard community than the women of Saba Mahmood’s seminal study could discard the veil. This book is effective in analyzing an African American Muslim mosque community in its particular urban landscape, and in examining how the gendered and classed dimensions are negotiated and reproduced Reviews 273"
The rivers in Kharkiv urban space: the history of interaction between nature and society (second half of the XVIIth - early XXIth century),2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0238f95aef07e040a3dace7933f67c80b0b84f32,,"Formulation of the problem. This article is devoted to the critical topic of modern Urban studies –the river’s role in urban space. There are many projects of the river’s revitalization in the USA, South Korea, and Europe. These projects improve the condition of climate and ecology in cities and renew rivers have become attractive places for citizens and tourists. In Ukraine, such projects are not so popular, but during the last years, in several cities NGOs, which try to attract attention to this topic, have appeared. Nevertheless, the revitalization project must begin from the deep investigation into the history and natural condition of the river. Therefore, this article’s object is the interaction between the Rivers and the Society in the Kharkiv urban space during the second half of 17th – the early 21st century.

The topic was divided to five periods. The first was the second half of 17 – the middle of 18, when the city was the fortress on The Wild Field’s border. Next – 1764 – 1860, when Kharkiv was the typical administrative center of The Russian Empire. Then 1860 – 1917, when the city’s impetuous development dramatically accelerated anthropogenic pressure on the urban space. The fourth – 1917 – 1991 when the town was under Soviet Urban policy. The last – the modern period of Ukrainian Independence, when the revitalization projects have become the actual.

Review of previous publications and studies. Kharkiv blue space’s condition was the important theme for historians, ecologists, architects and politics during the 19th – 21st centuries. The global subjects of the river in urban space were started to discuss in Europe in 19th century because of the influence to the river by the industry leading to ecological problems. During the last ten years, L. J. Martin attracted the attention to the history and revitalization of the Providence river (USA). S. Castonguay, M. Evenden published the profound research about the river in urban space. Jaime Lerner determined the place of river in his research «Acupuntura Urbana» Ukrainian ecologists continue to study the level of pollution in Udy, Kharkiv and Lopan.

Methods. Using the original Urban Studies methods we considered the rivers as a part of the symmetry urban network. It means that the river is an active actor of the urban connection and can influence the other elements of the net.

Results. During the five periods of our theme, river were played the next roles in urban space – sewage, zoning, economic, recreational, and aesthetic. The meaning and scale of these functions were changed according to the historical period. Unregulated use of water sources leads to the pollution of rivers, the spread of infection, and the floods.

Scientific novelty and practical significance. The revitalization process starts from the profound cross-disciplinary research about the place of rivers in Kharkiv Urban space. In this article we identified the periodization of the problem, the primary function of the rivers, and the changing of their roles during the period. The next step must be the project of revitalizing the rivers as the cultural object based of their history."
The role of urbanisation in the spread of Aedes mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit—A systematic review,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0261c2afaed863bdb319e999166fbc862c91ab1b,Antonios Kolimenakis; S. Heinz; Michael L Wilson; V. Winkler; L. Yakob; A. Michaelakis; D. Papachristos; C. Richardson; O. Horstick,"Background This systematic review aims to assess how different urbanisation patterns related to rapid urban growth, unplanned expansion, and human population density affect the establishment and distribution of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and create favourable conditions for the spread of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Methods and findings Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, Virtual Health Library, Cochrane, WHO Library Database (WHOLIS), Google Scholar, and and the Institutional Repository for Information Sharing (IRIS) databases. From a total of 523 identified studies, 86 were selected for further analysis, and 29 were finally analysed after applying all inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main explanatory variables used to associate urbanisation with epidemiological/entomological outcomes were the following: human population density, urban growth, artificial geographical space, urban construction, and urban density. Associated with the lack of a global definition of urbanisation, several studies provided their own definitions, which represents one of the study’s limitations. Results were based on 8 ecological studies/models, 8 entomological surveillance studies, 7 epidemiological surveillance studies, and 6 studies consisting of spatial and predictive models. According to their focus, studies were categorised into 2 main subgroups, namely “Aedes ecology” and “transmission dynamics.” There was a consistent association between urbanisation and the distribution and density of Aedes mosquitoes in 14 of the studies and a strong relationship between vector abundance and disease transmission in 18 studies. Human population density of more than 1,000 inhabitants per square kilometer was associated with increased levels of arboviral diseases in 15 of the studies. Conclusions The use of different methods in the included studies highlights the interplay of multiple factors linking urbanisation with ecological, entomological, and epidemiological parameters and the need to consider a variety of these factors for designing effective public health approaches."
Mining Social Media Data to Capture Urban Park Visitors’ Perception of Cultural Ecosystem Services and Landscape Factors,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0278c6cf55f8695ab978922c09133f233a9d6913,Yaxin Chen; Chuanchun Hong; Yifan Yang; Jiaxin Li; Yu Wang; Tianyu Zheng; Yinke Zhang; Feng Shao,"Urban parks not only enhance urban ecology but also play a crucial role in providing cultural ecosystem services (CESs) for the well-being of urban residents. Both artificial and natural landscape factors within parks contribute significantly to the supply of cultural ecosystem services. To explore public perceptions of landscape factors and CESs, this study focused on 25 urban parks in Hangzhou. Social media data uploaded by park visitors from 2018 to 2023 were collected to establish a corresponding CES indicator framework. Combining computer vision with text mining, we assessed the preferences and correlations between visitor-perceived CESs and park landscape factors. The results indicated that the majority of park visitors perceive CESs (80.00%) with overall satisfaction higher than importance. Among them, aesthetic experiences and recreation showed both high satisfaction and importance. In shared social media photos, arbor (19.01%), herbaceous flowers (8.99%), and grove (8.22%) were frequently presented as landscape factors. The study revealed close correlations between user gender, landscape factors, and perceived CES categories, with females contributing more to the perception of both. There were internal correlations within CES categories, with spiritual services, aesthetic experiences, and recreation showing the most significant associations. Different landscape factors impacted CES categories to varying degrees, and biological landscapes formed by plant and animal factors were considered to provide more CESs. These findings are significant for enhancing the quality of ecological services and biodiversity in parks."

Most agricultural pests are Tetranychinae (Zhang 2003, Hoy 2011). Migeon and Dorkeld (2019) mentioned 154 species in the genus Tetranychus Dufour (Trombidiformes: Tetranychidae) throughout the world. Red spider, Tetranychus merganser Boudreaux, is an important agricultural pest worldwide. The mite distributed in China, USA, Australia, and Mexico has been reported on apocynaceous, aquifoliaceous, cactaceous, caricaceous, cucurbitaceous, euphorbiaceous, leguminoseous, moringaceous, oleaceous, ranunculaceous, rosaceous, and solanaceous plants (Chacó-Hernández et al. 2020). Feeding by mites destroys epidermal tissue, parenchyma, and chloroplasts of leaves of host plants and is observed as small white spots near leaf veins, and with severe infestation, the spots can fuse, covering all the leaf (López 2014, López-Bautista et al. 2016, Montelongo-Ruíz et al. 2020).

and Mitigation Mode of Land Use Conflicts:
A Case Study of Shenyang City, China",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/029b750de6e16c7973ac6ee647bda89de2bea11d,Ruiqing Su; Ge Song; Quanxi Wang; Hongjun Sui; Gaofeng Ren,"Land use conflicts are spatial manifestations of human-land contradictions that threaten the region's sustainable development. To alleviate pressure on land resource utilization and guide the governance of land use conflicts, we drew on the ecological risk assessment conceptual framework and theories in landscape ecology. We then constructed a land use conflict identification model. In addition, land use conflicts under the food security constraint in 2030 were simulated and measured using the GMOP-PLUS coupled model from the sustainable development perspective. This was done under three scenarios: the natural development scenario, the high-quality development scenario, and the ecological protection scenario. The results showed that land use conflicts in Shenyang demonstrate an overall exacerbating trend and their spatial patterns remain relatively stable. They were characterized by low intensity in the core urban areas and high intensity in other areas. Compared to 2019, the intensity of land use conflicts in Shenyang will decrease under three scenarios in 2030, with significant alleviation observed under the ecological protection scenario. The impact of socio-economic policies and ecological governance policies on alleviating land use conflicts in Shenyang shows significant differences. This study offers significant contributions to understanding land use conflict governance and regulation."

Cogǎlniceanu,"The pond slider (Trachemys scripta) is a major invasive species in freshwater habitats across the world. For decades, the main cause of individuals’ occurrences in the wild was the illegal release of pet animals. Recently, as an important component of their management, there has been an increasing focus on their ability to successfully reproduce in the invaded regions. In Romania, the species is reported as widespread in urban wetland environments within major cities, but information about its nesting and potential breeding remains scarce or anecdotal. We surveyed a large population of pond sliders in an artificial urban wetland site in Constanţa, SE Romania, and described their nesting ecology and reproductive output. Although eggs from several nests failed to hatch or were predated, potentially limiting their reproductive success, sliders were found to breed successfully at this site, with 18.6% viable hatchlings recorded. Our study could serve as a baseline for additional targeted surveys and to inform decision-making for successfully managing this invasive species. Although the importation, trading, and breeding of this species are prohibited by EU legislation, active and effective management is now required to address the successful reproduction and further potential spread of T. scripta."

Walubwa; S. Owuor; P. Kasaija; Hakimu Sseviiri; Gloria Nsangi; Disan Byarugaba,"African cities are largely less-built with agile informal settlements and multiple ecologies that harbor different pathways for resilience to climate change. We undertook a qualitative systematic review of academic and policy evidence, to address the question of what interventions are emerging at neigbourhood to city scale to enhance resilience to climate change in Africa. Resilience at neigbourhood scale often stems from harnessing the local resource base and technologies for urban agriculture and forestry; alternative energy from wastes; grassed drainages for protection against erosion; recreation along dry riverbeds; fog-water harvesting; and adjustments in irrigation schedules. At city scale, planning is targeted at buildings, mobility and energy service delivery as the objects to be made resilient. The review established that evidence on comparisons across regions is mainly on East, West and South African cities, and much less on cities in Northern and Central Africa. Ecological comparisons are majorly on coastal and inland cities, with minimal representation of semi-arid and mountainous cities. Resilience efforts in capital cities are the most dominant in the literature, with less emphasis on secondary cities and towns, which is necessary for a deeper understanding of the role played by inter-municipal and inter-metropolitan collaborations. African cities can bring context-sensitivity to global debates on climate resilience, if theoretical perspectives are generated from emerging interventions across case studies. We conclude with suggestions on what future research needs to take on, if evidence on resilience to climate change in African cities is to be strengthened."
"Ecological urban design: Concepts, approaches, education",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02e168eba5acf771cad97426a774d5a75bedef85,Jelena Živković,"Enhancing the sustainability and resilience of cities requires a shift in the approach to planning and designing urban spaces. An ecological perspective is essential in achieving this, yet it is often narrowly applied, focusing solely on ""greening"" objects and spaces. This fails to fully harness the potential of the relationship between urban design and ecology, which is crucial for addressing specific development challenges and the unique characteristics of each urban context. This lecture addresses the knowledge and skills required to effectively apply an ecological approach to urban design. It aims to introduce and discuss the basic concepts of ecological urbanism, as well as different approaches and thematic areas for integrating ecological considerations into the design of urban space. This broad understanding is essential for informed and effective action. On this basis, the ecological approach to architectural and planning education is established, which not only cultivates technical expertise but also helps students develop their ecological thinking and literacy. The working process and outcomes of the Studio M01U ""Ecological Urban Design"" course at the UB Faculty of Architecture illustrate this educational approach."

Baiketuerhan; Weixia Wang,"Abstract Potential trace elements pollution in cities poses a threat to the environment and human health. Bio-availability affects toxicity levels of potential trace elementss on organisms. This study focused on exploring the relationship between soil, plant, and atmospheric dust pollution in Urumqi, a typical city in western China. It aims to help reduce pollution and protect residents’ health. The following conclusions were drawn: 1) potential trace elementss like Cr, Pb, As, and Ni are more prevalent in atmospheric dust and soil than in plants. Chromium was in the first group, Cadmium and Mercury were in the second, and Plumb, Arsenic, and Nickel were in the third. Atmospheric dust and soil exhibit a significantly higher heavy metal content than plants. For example, The atmospheric dust summary Chromium content was up to 88 mg/kg. 2) Soil, atmospheric dust, and plants have the highest amount of residual form. Residual form had the highest percentage average of 53.3%, whereas Organic matter bound form had the lowest percentage of just 7.7%. The plants contained less residual heavy metal than the soil and atmospheric dust. 3) The correlation coefficient between the carbonated form content of Cd of soil and atmospheric dust is 0.95, which is closely related. Other potential trace elements show similar correlations in their bio-available contents in soil, plants, and atmospheric dust. This study suggests that in urban area, the focus should be on converting potential trace elements into residual form instead of increasing plants’ absorption of potential trace elements. Graphical Abstract NOVELTY STATEMENT The current research in China primarily examines heavy metal pollution in the atmosphere, soil, and plants individually. Although there is significant international research on heavy metal bio-availability in the environment, few studies have focused on the presence of heavy metals in soil, vegetation, and atmospheric dust. Therefore, this study focused on Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, a typical oasis city in the arid region. To understand the bio-availability and morphological characteristics of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, Cr, As, Ni) in the soil-plant-atmosphere of its urban expressway. This study aims to establish a theoretical basis for understanding the pollution hazards caused by heavy metals in oasis cities. It will have practical significance in maintaining urban ecology, promoting sustainable development, and safeguarding citizens’ health."

Couvet,"We examine how ecological sciences have completed the idea of ecosystem balance with notions of steady-state regime, tipping-points and ecosystem transformation. In this context, it is possible to propose a notion of ecosystem integrity that includes diversity of the compositions, structures and functions of the ecosystem, and as such could be considered as a reference state. These three diversities must allow ecosystems to cope with disturbances, adapt to environmental changes, and consequently allow the maintenance of human activities that depend on the functioning of ecosystems, their predictability. Finally, we explore how such reference state diversities is relevant depending on the degree of anthropization, in 'natural', agricultural and urban ecosystems, or in the context of ‘One-Health’."

Alexakis; Christos Polykretis,"Multi-temporal Land use and Land cover (LULC) monitoring is a crucial parameter for assessing an area’s landscape ecology regime. LULC changes can be effectively used to describe dynamics of both urban or rural environments and vegetation patterns as an important indicator of ecological environments. In this context, spatial land use properties can be quantified by using a set of landscape metrics. Landscape metrics capture inherent spatial structure of the environment and are used to enhance interpretation of spatial pattern of the landscape. This study aims to monitor diachronically the LULC regime of the island of Crete, Greece with the use of Landsat satellite imageries (Landsat 5, Landsat-7 and Landsat-8) in terms of soil erosion. For this reason, radiometric and atmospheric corrections are applied to all satellite products and unsupervised classification algorithms are used to develop detail LULC maps of the island. The LULC classes are developed by generalizing basic CORINE classes. Following, various landscape metrics are applied to estimate the temporal changes in LULC patterns of the island. The results denote that the diachronic research of spatial patterns evolution can effectively assist to the investigation of the structure, function and landscape pattern changes."
Minimalism as a strategy for overcoming information overload of interface design for interactive city devices,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0338a025dd09f0ff85d34f6108d6e106a771e199,V E Ryabinina-Zadernovskaya,"The article is devoted to the consideration of the issues of forming a comfortable urban information environment using graphic design, namely, minimalism as a strategy for organizing visual information obtained through interaction with interactive interfaces in the urban environment. In modern megacities, devices with a touch screen increasingly provide the organization of the process of information interaction between a city and a person. From a visual point of view, they provide ample opportunities for the implementation of a graphic form. However, at the same time, the question remains to what extent the visual design of the software of urban information carriers affects the efficiency of their use, and how their aesthetic characteristics form the information and graphic ecology of the city. In recent years, the information space has expanded significantly; therefore, the organization of an environmentally friendly urban graphical environment has turned out to be associated with the need to apply approaches to organizing data that can reduce information and visual noise, as well as reduce the level of information pollution of the surrounding urban environment. This circumstance, on the one hand, enhances the importance of interaction design as a primary stage in creating an effective information design. On the other hand, it promotes a conscious restriction in the use of graphical tools, reflecting an ethical approach to interface design."

"Ecological and Allergenic Significance of Atmospheric Pollen Spectra from a Grassland-Savanna Ecotone in North West Province, South Africa",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0385f68af9336a832fdcaa9d972f87241393fe4c,F.

Peter,"ABSTRACT Southern Africa's floral, topographic and climatic diversity manifests in distinctive bioregions where aerobiology studies are needed to manage allergenic health problems, especially in urban areas. Previous studies underline different seasonal pollen fluctuations for the biomes, encouraging regional studies. These studies have been previously restricted to large cities such as Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria whereas small cities such as Potchefstroom in the North-West province are understudied. The South African Pollen Monitoring Network (SAPNET) seeks to fill this lacuna, enhancing ecological and health-related knowledge, with regard to the allergenicity of the recorded pollen. Here, we investigate plant phenology and resulting pollen production within the Grassland and Savanna biomes around Potchefstroom, a fast-growing city in the North West province, comparing it with other SAPNET sites. As a SAPNET initiative, pollen monitoring in Potchefstroom involved monthly collections using a Lanzoni 7-day spore trap over 13 months from December 2022 to 2023. This facilitated the development of a preliminary pollen calendar and a pollen atlas, detailing pollen types' morphology, ecology, pollination modes, and allergenicity. Initial findings revealed Potchefstroom's pollen calendar, with tree pollen (60% of the Annual Pollen Index (API)) mainly from northern hemisphere species such as Cupressus (c. 11% of API) and Platanus (c. 18%), which released pollen in spring. Grass pollen was predominant from November to April (c. 18% of API). Potchefstroom recorded South Africa's highest levels of Ambrosia pollen (c. 7% of API), a major allergen, in March and April. Noteworthy is the unusual abundance of pollen of the neophyte Ulmus (c. 14%) in December. This study highlights the pollen patterns of the Grassland and Savanna biomes around Potchefstroom. The region, with its mosaic of urban spaces, natural grass-/woodland, and agricultural land, exhibits distinct characteristics when contrasted with major, more densely populated cities such as Bloemfontein, Pretoria, and Johannesburg."
A review of the opportunities to support pollinator populations in South African cities,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/039b1e268e78e7e6e9c62b6ca67cdc83f76c398a,Peta Brom; L. Underhill; K. Winter,"Globally insects are declining, but some guilds of pollinators are finding refuge in urban landscapes. The body of knowledge on urban pollinators is relatively mature, which means it is now possible to begin to make generalization. Unfortunately, studies do not represent climatic regions evenly and there is a gap in research from the African continent. This study aimed to address some of the gaps on urban pollination knowledge in South Africa and to identify opportunities to improve urban habitats for pollinators. We reviewed the international literature on urban pollinators and the South African literature on pollinators with a landscape ecology focus, drawing on literature with an emphasis on agricultural and ecosystem services. The findings show that some taxa (e.g. large-bodied, cavity nesting bees) will exploit urban environments increasing in abundance with urban intensity. Moderately sensitive taxa (such as small-bodied, ground-nesting bees) take advantage of urban environments only if local habitats are supportive of their needs for resource provision and habitat connectivity. The South African urban poor rely on pollination services for subsistence agriculture and the reproduction of wild-foraged medicines and food. Potential interventions to improve habitat quality include strategic mowing practices, conversion of turf-grass to floral rich habitats, scientific confirmation of lists of highly attractive flowers, and inclusion of small-scale flower patches throughout the urban matrix. Further research is needed to fill the Africa gap for both specialized and generalized pollinators (Diptera, Halictids, Lepidoptera and Hopliini) in urban areas where ornamental and indigenous flowering plants are valued."
Tree Crown Detection using UAV-captured High-Resolution Aerial Images for Baghdad University Campus,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03a0da8f8456395ab438c1bc05db6af87c1dbc9f,Mohammed M. Wadod; Faisel G. Mohammed,"The research paper's objective is to develop an automated system that uses high-resolution aerial images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to accurately detect and analyze tree crowns on the Baghdad University campus. This analysis of tree crowns is crucial for assessing vegetation health and distribution in urban areas, with applications in urban planning, ecology, and environmental studies. The proposed system utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and delineate tree crowns, facilitating objective analysis of tree canopy coverage. The study employed a Phantom Four drone flying at a height of 55 meters with an 80% overlap in image coverage. Ground control points were established using the Topcon_HIPER2 device and Static GPS Surveying Techniques. The flight plan was designed with PIX4Dcapture software, and the resulting ortho-map had a 2 cm resolution. The research used the YOLOv3 artificial intelligence technique for tree detection after training a customized dataset. The model achieved impressive performance metrics, including a low loss function value of 0.023, a high SDC value of 0.984, and a robust Jaccard Index value of 0.943."

The ‘Tree of Objectives’ is substantiated, which determines contemporary fields of development of green facades. For the first time, a methodology for choosing variants of the project design and technology solution of vertical gardening is proposed. In the work, multi-factor landscape ecological analysis is used; the analytical method of system analysis – the Analytic Hierarchy Process – is discussed. The author of the method is Thomas L. Saaty (USA), who represents the structure of a practical decision as a hierarchy, with further decomposition of the problem into more simple elements, and further, in the processing of the sequence of judgments of a decision maker on the basis of comparing elements to each other two at a time. In result, the intensity of interaction between elements in the hierarchy is described, and then, the judgments are expressed numerically. The method includes the procedures of synthesis of multiple judgments, of obtaining priority ranking of criteria, and finding alternative solutions. The proposed method for evaluation of a group of factors is universally applicable and can be easily used in practice, and also is the basis for preliminary selection of urban environment factors for creation of a comfort environment in the course of realization of landscape ecological properties of vertical gardening. The use of the system analysis method allows solving the analytical problem of choosing a design solution for vertical gardening system."

The need for innovative Urban Building Energy Modeling grows, yet existing building archetypes often fail to capture the unique attributes of local buildings and the nuanced distinctions between different cities, jeopardizing the precision of energy modeling. This paper presents an alternative tool employing self-supervised learning to distill complex geometric data into representative, locale-specific archetypes. This study attempts to foster a new paradigm of interaction with built environments, incorporating local parameters to conduct bespoke energy simulations at the community level. The catered archetypes can augment the precision and applicability of energy consumption modeling at different scales across diverse building inventories. This tool provides a potential solution that encourages the exploration of emerging local ecologies. By integrating building envelope characteristics and cultural granularity into the building archetype generation process, we seek a future where architecture and urban design are intricately interwoven with the energy sector in shaping our built environments."
Towards Radical Coexistence in the City: Performing the bio-urban in Bonnie Ora Sherk’s The Farm and Mierle Laderman Ukeles’s Flow City,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03e184673fb3add347639fb25a78d67a30229317,Lisa Woynarski,"The current dark ecological context has prompted resurgence in debate about the concepts of hope, despair, responsibility and urbanism. Both Bonnie Ora Sherk's The Farm (San Francisco 1974-1980) and Mierle Laderman Ukeles' work at the New York Sanitation Department (1976-present), revision human/more-than-human relationships and interactions, conceiving of an urban community as made up a multiple species and people. Their work provides models for radical coexistence, breaking down reductive urban/nature and nature/culture binaries. Recontextualising these formative performance works in light of contemporary developments and an intersectional ecological analysis, I argue they act as key sites for addressing critical issues of urbanisation and ecology. We are living in the urban century as global patterns of urban migration mean that more than half the world's population now live in cities. Given this growth, cities represent vital landscapes for ecological thought. However, the longstanding ontological distinction between the city and the natural world has led to the growth of cities in ways that do not always support long-term human and non-human life, health and wellbeing. My concept, the bio-urban, invokes the ecological vibrancy of the city and considers humans (and nonhuman species) in urban habitats as active participants of ecology, from an ecomaterialism position. I utilise the bio-urban as a conceptual framework to draw together expanded practices of performance from Sherk and Ukeles, to challenge the false urban/nature dichotomy and replace the clichéd image of eco performance as a reverential walk through a ‘green and pleasant land'. Both artists take an intersectional approach to urban ecology, which nuances and informs the bio-urban. In ‘dark’ times of ecological uncertainty, performance can be a site to challenge destructive thinking, bringing to light invisible relationships, blindspots, imaginative utopias and alternative possibilities for what it means to coexist today."

In this review, different sustainable practices in urban horticulture such as vertical gardening, hydroponics, aquaponics, rooftop gardening, composting, and rainwater harvesting are discussed. It also emphasizes the importance of urban agroforestry, intelligent irrigation systems, and integrated pest management in the promotion of sustainable green spaces in urban areas. The benefits and limitations of these strategies are analyzed, highlighting their effects on urban ecology, climate resilience, socio-economic well-being, and environmental conservation. The review is finalized with policy integration, technological innovation, and public participation recommendations to maximize the sustainability of urban horticulture. In addition, it presents future strategies for sustainable food production in cities, new green technologies, and the incorporation of urban agriculture into the development of cities in order to guarantee long-term sustainability and efficiency."
Constructing Landscape Ecological Security Patterns of an Ancient Capital Based on Cellular Automata Theory,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/042b09084346d0e486b02b6935ee6d145f865ed1,Xuhui Wang; Jianwei Li; Tuo Zheng; Shupeng Diao; Xue Zhang; Yu-lou Tian,"Urban sprawl in developing countries changes urban land use structure and function, and threatens the sustainable development of regional ecology and security patterns of city landscapes. A new way to control urban sprawl is to develop a comprehensive landscape security plan, analyze factors influencing urban growth, optimize land use and demarcate a growth boundary. Here, we use Xi’an, China, as a case study to analyze scenarios of landscape security pattern and urban spatial control to explore urban spatial zoning. We construct a theoretical framework of a landscape security pattern to manage urban spatial expansion from the perspective of landscape security and urban smart growth. As a first step, the integrated landscape security pattern is constructed based on four factors: hydrology, geological disasters, cultural heritage, and recreation. Second, the urban spatial expansion model is simulated based on a cellular automata model. Finally, nine land-use patterns are developed by overlaying integrated landscape security patterns and urban spatial expansion. Thus, urban space is divided into three types of zoning scenarios: suitable construction, restricted construction, and prohibited construction. The calculations indicate that the zoning area of the three types accounted for 10.4%, 14.7%, and 74.9%, respectively, of the total area in Xi’an. It is of great significance to determine the spatial contradiction between development and protection in the process of urban expansion and to establish a schema of suitable urban land use. We discuss the rapid urbanization process in developing countries at the macro scale, and formulate a land use plan that balances development and protection."
LEGAL NATURE OF USE AND PROTECTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN SETTLEMENTS,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04396e7f1dc2efe3d081fea2e3bdeff2758d14fa,Guzal Uzakova,"The article explains the concept of settlement based on scientific and theoretical concepts and current legislation. The author has developed his own independent approach to the division of settlements into species. The legal description and nature of the settlements are also revealed. The article examines the main environmental problems in cities, the solution of which is considered in the framework of the new UN Urban Development Program (Habitat III). The author pays special attention to ensuring the quality of the environment in settlements, strict adherence to environmental standards and thus ensuring the rights of individual to a comfortable environment. At the same time, the need to ensure the harmony of ecological, economic and social aspects of urban development as one of the important conditions for sustainable development is scientifically justified. The author scientifically and legally analyzes the issues of environmentalization of production, industry, construction, acoustic impact in settlements, environmental and legal requirements for the protection of atmospheric air, compliance with sanitary norms related to water resources and public health. The article substantiates the need for the State Committee for Ecology and Environmental Protection of the Republic of Uzbekistan to introduce a procedure for conducting an «environmental rating» of cities with the broad involvement of the public. Based on the research conducted on the topic, conclusions of scientific and practical significance have been developed."

Saint Petersburg realias and experience of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Hamburg",2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/043fbcdb9ade5342ad0aa9bf4dc8732e87404e55,F. Perov; L. Lavrov; A. Eremeeva,"Results of the first stage of territory development in the Gulf of Finland near the western coast of Vasilyevsky Island in Saint Petersburg are rated unsatisfactory. Results in the field of aesthetics, ecology, social stability and functional arrangement of the urban environment on new lands are negative. According to the analysis of experience in coastal areas' reconstruction in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Hamburg, ambitious goals that were set for the project in Saint Petersburg were not achieved due to defects of the urban planning system — there was no centralized project management, activities of contractors, who neglected exclusive potential of the coastal area and its proximity to the historical core of the city, were insufficiently coordinated and controlled. It is argued that this is due to inertia of the Saint Petersburg design and construction system. During many years, it was focused on large-scale residential development of vast peripheral territories and, therefore, it was not capable to resolve issues related to development of highly urbanized environment in the city center. Omissions made during construction of a highway through the residential area are identified. The highway design does not provide reliable protection against negative impact on residential quarters. The route of the highway was designed as a bypass of the city center, but it became the shortest route to the center. It is noted that further development will offer opportunities for partial correction of the errors made. The new management team of the city architectural services considers the territory perspective for expansion of the Saint Petersburg center towards the water area of the Gulf of Finland."

Meanwhile, combining with the outside factors affecting the supply efficiency, we explore and identify the existing problems of marine ecology products in this region, such as the unreasonable supply structure, regional development imbalance, marine environment quality degrading, etc., and present the corresponding solutions and rationalization proposal for the existing problems, thus providing a new thought for promoting the development of the Yangtze River Delta, especially for marine activities."
The Temporal And Spatial Changes Of Beijing’s Pm 2.5 Concentration And Its Relationship With Meteorological Factors From 2015 To 2020,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/044be5388988dd9d4bd197532d73519e82fb5d17,Guo Peng; A. Umarova; G. Bykova,"Currently, Beijing is facing increasing serious air quality problems. Atmospheric pollutants in Beijing are mainly composed of particulate matter, which is a key factor leading to adverse effects on human health. This paper uses hourly data from 36 environmental monitoring stations in Beijing from 2015 to 2020 to obtain the temporal and spatial distribution of the mass concentration of particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5). The 36 stations established by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment and the Beijing Environmental Protection Monitoring Center and obtain continuous real-time monitoring of particulate matter. And the 36 stations are divided into 13 main urban environmental assessment points, 11 suburban assessment points, 1 control point, 6 district assessment points, and 5 traffic pollution monitoring points. The annual average concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing was 60 μg/m3 with a negative trend of approximately 14% year-1. In urban areas the annual average concentration of PM2.5 was 59 μg/m3, in suburbs 56 μg/m3, in traffic areas 63 μg/m3, and in district areas 62 μg/m3. From 2015 to 2020, in urban areas PM2.5 decreased by 14% year-1, in suburbs by 15% year -1, in traffic areas by 15% year-1, and in district areas by 12% year-1. The quarterly average concentrations of PM2.5 in winter andspring are higher than those in summer and autumn (64 μg/m3, 59 μg/m3, 45 μg/m3, 55 μg/m3, respectively). The influenceof meteorological factors on the daily average value of PM2.5 in each season was analysed. The daily average PM2.5 in spring, summer, autumn and winter is significantly negatively correlated with daily average wind speed, sunshine hours, and air pressure, and significantly positively correlated with daily average rainfall and relative humidity. Except for autumn, the daily average PM2.5 is positively correlated with temperature. Although Beijing’s PM2.5 has been declining since the adoption of the‘Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan’, it is still far from the first level of the new ‘Ambient Air Quality Standard’(GB309S-2012) formulated by China in 2012."
Effects of Anthropogenic Disturbance of Natural Habitats on the Feeding Ecology of Moorish Geckos,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/046a15705076a3300e93fe69a7f1e73c485211bf,José Martín; Jesús Ortega; R. García‐Roa; Gonzalo Rodríguez-Ruiz; Ana Pérez‐Cembranos; V. Pérez‐Mellado,"Simple Summary Humans can alter the habitat quality and negatively affect many animals. However, some species seem able to cope with or even take advantage of these alterations. This study examines the effects of small anthropogenic alterations of a natural habitat on the feeding ecology of a gecko, Tarentola mauritanica. We compared geckos found in two contiguous small islands with either natural or human-altered seminatural habitats. Results showed that seminatural habitats differed from actual natural habitats in some microhabitat characteristics and in diversity of available prey. The diet of geckos also differed between habitats, being less diverse in altered habitats. However, the health state (body condition) of geckos was similar between habitats. These geckos seem able to modify their diet selection patterns to cope with anthropic disturbances of the habitat, which would allow them to inhabit and prosper in human-altered ecosystems. Abstract Urbanization and anthropic influences can drastically modify a natural habitat and transform it into an easily recognizable “urban habitat”. Human activities can also induce less severe modifications of what apparently might still look like natural habitats. Therefore, these subtle alterations may be hidden but can still cause important negative effects on plant and animals. In contrast, some species seem able to take advantage of these anthropic alterations. Here, we examined the possible effects of the anthropogenic disturbance of an apparent natural habitat on the feeding ecology and body condition of Moorish geckos, Tarentola mauritanica. For this, we compared microhabitat structure, invertebrate availability, the diet composition (estimated from fecal contents), diet selection patterns and body condition of the two populations of geckos inhabiting two contiguous small islands. These islands have similar environmental characteristics, but highly contrasting differences in urbanization and anthropogenic influence. We found that, although the abundance of potential invertebrate prey was similar on both habitats, the diversity of invertebrate prey was lower in the altered habitat. As a consequence, although composition of the diet of geckos was similar on both islands, the diversity of prey and food niche breadth were lower in the altered habitat, and patterns of diet selection changed. However, these inter-habitat differences did not seem to affect the body size and body condition of geckos. We discuss how flexibility in feeding ecology may allow some species to cope with small anthropic disturbances of the habitat."

While historically overlooked, these processes shape urban growth and pose challenges in fragile states. Despite the focus on celebrity materials such as coal and oil, historically, non-celebrity resources such as sand and gravel have also played vital roles. Recognizing the significance of peri-urban landscapes, particularly in regions such as the U.S. Great Plains is crucial to balancing design, extraction, and ecology. The peri-urban sand and gravel extraction sites above the Ogallala Aquifer are filling with groundwater and result in recreational and residential lakes that reshape the urban edges. This essay explores the transformation of these post-extraction sandpit lakes, highlighting opportunities for new design interventions and emphasizing the need for responsible interdisciplinary practices that balance human needs with ecological concerns."

Rao,"The unchecked growing urbanization in the metropolises like Bangalore at the cost of ecology is a matter of grave concern for mankind as it has been one of the most detrimental factors to environment and a major contributing factor too to global warming and its corollary adverse effects to ecosystem. The urban authorities too hardly ever have a genuine concern for the irreparable damage being caused to the environment in the haphazard implementation of the town planning schemes. On the other hand, the urban dwellers are incessantly in blind pursuit of materialistic affluence hence they too are alarmingly heedless to the future ecological hazards which will be inherited to their progenies. The so called urban development needs a profound introspection for one and all. Karnad has rightly endeavored to share his concern in this regard in one of his later plays Boiled Beans On Toast which deals with the concurrent problem of India. The issue of the chasm between the haves and have-nots in this insensitive civilization also comes to the fore by the by. The growing problem of traffic which is the cause of noise and air pollution is also brought forth in the play."

The impact of urban green space on the health of middle-aged and older adults,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04ccadeef2a90fbf36d7e1c9c1e969488a40c16b,Qiangyi Li; Yangqing Liu; Lan Yang; Jiexiao Ge; Xiaona Chang; Xiaohui Zhang,"Introduction Urban green space is one of the most closely related ecosystem services to residents’ lives, and it can be regarded as a preventive public health measure. Residents living in parks and other green environments can help improve their physical and mental health, reduce stress and even prevent crime and violence. Therefore, based on the actual situation in China, this paper analyzes the relationship between urban green space and the health of middle-aged and older adults and its mechanisms. Methods This study used multiple linear regression, based the data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) in 2013, 2015, and 2018, to explore the relationship between urban green space and the health of middle-aged and older adults. At the same time, group regression was conducted to identify the heterogeneity of health effects of urban green space. Results The research shows that the increase of urban green space areas can significantly improve the health status of middle-aged and older adults. After a series of robustness tests, the results are still valid. In addition, the health effects of urban green space are different because of gender, age, education level, marital status residence, geographical location of the respondents and park quantity distribution. Further research found that reducing hot weather and optimizing air quality are the potential mechanisms of urban green space affecting the health of middle-aged and older adults, providing new evidence for the causal mechanism between urban green space and the health of middle-aged and older adults. Discussion This study expanded the research scope of the impact of urban green space on the health of middle-aged and older adults, covering a representative sample in China. The results show that urban green space has an important impact on the health of middle-aged and older adults. Policy suggestions are made to help cities optimize the landscape and residents to enjoy ecology."
The making of an uneven shore: How coastal management and housing policies shaped racial inequality in asbury park NJ,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04e6035499e4df130ab5f71070c0ed188e1c87fd,David C. Eisenhauer,"Recent work in urban geography and political ecology has explored the roots of housing segregation in the United States within governmental polices and racial prejudice within the real estate sector. Additional research has demonstrated how coastal management practices has largely benefited wealthy, white communities. In this paper, I bring together insights from these two strands of research to demonstrate how both coastal management and governmental housing policies combined to shape racial inequalities within and around Asbury Park, New Jersey. By focusing on the period between 1945 and 1970, I show how local, state, and federal actors repeatedly prioritized improving and protecting the beachfront areas of the northern New Jersey shore while promising to eventually address the housing and economic needs of the predominately Black ‘West Side’ neighbourhood of Asbury Park. This paper demonstrates that not only did governmental spending on coastal management largely benefit white suburban homeowners but also came at the expense of promised spending within Black neighbourhoods. The case study has implications for other coastal regions in the United States in which housing segregation persists. As climate change and sea level rise unfold, the history of racial discrimination in coastal development raises important considerations for efforts to address emerging hazards and risks."

Enhancing urban resilience and strengthening cities’ ability to adapt and recover from disasters have become hot topics globally. Although urban resilience evaluation has been studied from different dimensions, the study of urban resilience from a practitioner’s perspective has received less attention. In this study, based on 1464 valid samples of practitioners in Huangshi City, a structural equation model (SEM) was applied to evaluate urban resilience. The evaluation indicators framework was selected from the economy, ecology, society, and infrastructure dimensions. The findings show that (1) the SEM model provides a scientific basis for establishing an index system for the comprehensive evaluation of urban resilience, and the corresponding correlation coefficients help determine the relative contribution of each indicator. (2) Social resilience accounts for the largest proportion of the entire evaluation system, followed by infrastructure resilience, ecological resilience, and economic resilience. (3) Taking Huangshi City as an empirical research case, the results show that the resilience assessment method based on SEM is feasible, with the resilience of Huangshi City showing an upward trend from 2013 to 2022. Finally, some plausible measures to improve urban resilience based on the evaluation results are discussed."

Lewis,"This article examines the multisensory nature of everyday life and the ways in which sound shapes experiences of community, presenting findings from a research project, ‘Place and belonging: What can we learn from Claremont Court housing scheme?’ Whilst acknowledging the multisensory nature of perception, the discussion focuses on sound in particular, exploring the different ways that sound (or lack of it) informed residents’ neighbouring practices and sense of community. Despite general fears of ‘loss of community’ due to increasing individualisation, the findings show the continued importance of neighbouring relations, which point to varied types of community attachment. Cases are presented from the data focusing on the themes of nostalgia, uncertainty and feelings of difference. These themes provide telling insights into the ways in which community is experienced and how people living in the same housing scheme interpret sounds differently. All residents were exposed to similar sound ecologies, but their significance and meanings were understood in vastly different ways. The article offers an original contribution by arguing that sound is an important dimension of everyday life in urban settings, which is related to affective and emotional dimensions of community, which have, as yet, been glossed over in the sociological literature."

Grand Challenges in Vector-Borne Disease Control Targeting Vectors,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0502706ae9b95737a85112d35bbb2b7bb197f43d,B. Torto; D. Tchouassi,"The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that the global population is expected to reach 9.8 billion in 2050 and projects growth mainly in global urban populations. The implications of this growth include changes in the urban environment, which will play an important role in public health, especially a significant proportion of global vector-borne tropical infectious diseases. Combined with these predicted developments is climate change and land use changes which will also greatly alter the tropical disease landscape and impact on public and veterinary health systems, especially of low-income countries. These factors will promote increasingly the convergence of humans, animal reservoirs of pathogens, and vector species to perpetuate the cycle of vector-borne diseases (VBDs) especially in the tropics. Indeed 80% of the world’s human population is at risk of one or more VBDs. Currently, approximately 20% of the global tropical infectious disease burden is vector-borne and this accounts for about 1 million human deaths annually, although the mortality rate in sub-Saharan Africa is disproportionately higher (1). The major global VBDs and those of focal importance can be caused by pathogens including parasites, viruses and bacteria vectored by mosquitoes (malaria, lymphatic filariasis, yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, Zika virus disease, Japanese encephalitis); sand flies (leishmaniasis, Sandfly fever); blackflies (Onchocerciasis), fleas (Tungiasis, plague); lice (Typhus, Louse-borne relapsing fever); tsetse flies (human African trypanosomosis); triatome bugs (Chagas disease); ticks (Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme disease, Relapsing fever (borreliosis), Tularemia); aquatic snails (Schistosomiasis). In the last 3 decades, previously controlled vector-borne diseases have resurged or remerged in new geographic areas, with some disease outbreaks affecting humans triggered by several novel pathogens (2). Few vaccines have been developed for preventive control of vector-borne diseases. Additionally, reports of resistance to drugs and insecticides by vector-borne pathogens and vectors, respectively, are increasing. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new or complementary control tools for VBDs with vector control as a pillar to curb vector-human contact. Despite this recognition, underlying constraints associated with existing control measures against VBDs including vector adaptive strategies need to be addressed. Several priority research areas have been identified most of which target weak links in the pathogen-vector-host interactions. Examples include physical cues, chemical ecology, transmission blocking, vector adaptation including influence of xenobiotics on vector biology, and genetic control approaches. Notably, during these three decades, an in-depth research to understand the mechanisms underpinning pathogen-vector-host interactions have provided new insights into both the biology of vectors and pathogens of VBDs. The role of physical cues such as vision, temperature, auditory, vibration, and humidity in vector biology has been well established. Chemical cues are also important for most vectors to exploit biological processes for their survival including plant feeding, host seeking, oviposition site selection, aggregation, mate finding and defense.

Urbanism and Cultural Studies: Synergy of Methodological Approaches (on the Example of the City of Vladivostok),2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0506fb3b905333a4301a8cab15662338975d27e5,N. Malinina,"The article examines the influence of cultural studies on urban studies and urban studies on cultural studies. The purpose of the research is to consider architectural problems of city development based on a cultural approach. This methodological approach shows the interdependence of urbanism and cultural studies and leads to a synergistic effect of city development. Hermeneutical methodology is used to analyze the behavioral attitudes of citizens, and the system methodology of urbanism allows to identify ensembles in architectural structures. The unity of the culturological and urban allows us to immerse the problem field of the city in the context of human existence. The material is architectural ensembles of the city of Vladivostok: Central streets, new buildings of the theater and aquarium, and plans for the construction of a theater and Museum complex. As a result, a new architectural element of the artistic image of the city appears. The necessity of ecology of the visual environment of the city is emphasized, including the upbringing of a citizen who takes care of the construction and architectural heritage and the environment. The architectural and artistic image of the city sets requirements for the development of the competence of citizens as people who are attracted to artistic processes. Educational institutions are included in this architectural and artistic image as an institution that forms a fully developed person. The architectural and artistic image of the city is intended to have a synergistic effect of development on the city."

Becoming urban: How city life shapes the social structure and genetics of ants,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/052a95b1257322e01cdfb558614964ec5caa0653,Milan Janda,"Cities and urban environments can do peculiar things to biodiversity that shares them with us. How cities affect their invited and uninvited inhabitants has become an increasingly important question. More than half of the world's population dwells in urban areas, and these environments will keep expanding considerably. Understanding how this relatively recent, rapid, and pervasive form of landscape modification influences the ecology and evolution of organisms that cannot escape, or may benefit from it, is an emerging field of biology. Although we are aware of how some birds, mammals or plants respond to urban environments, less is known about insects and invertebrates in general. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Blumenfeld et al. (2022) bring new remarkable insights into how a common ant species adjusts to urban settings across the United States by changing its social structure and behaviour. Using a large‐scale molecular, chemical and behavioural dataset, they document how the odorous house ant Tapinoma sessile differs in its colony organisation and dispersal strategy between rural and urban habitats. In each of the study regions and continent‐wide, rural and urban colonies are genetically and chemically differentiated, suggesting that urban settings act as potent agents of selection and isolation. The novelty and importance of this study are that it documents multiple independent transitions toward the same social organisation and the apparent effect of habitat on the life history of a eusocial insect species."

Hedelin; J. Alkan-Olsson; L.

However, we need to know more of how collaboration can function as integrating (and integrated) components of governance systems. Three regulated Swedish rivers are used here as examples to explore factors that influence this function. The following factors are identified: transparency of value trade-offs, understanding of collaboration and governance, interplay between public sectors, integrating funding mechanisms, clarity of mandate, strategic use of networks and consistency of the governance system. As a consequence of the poor management of these factors in our case, water quality and ecology values are not integrated in strategic decision making, e.g., regarding hydropower, urban development or climate adaptation. Instead, they are considered add-ons, or “decorations”. The Swedish case illustrates the meaning of the factors and their great importance for achieving sustainable governance."

Conventional use of media for ageing has made the aged population a passive victim to be duped by the media messages. Given the structural locations and positions, mass media is of no use where the considerations are for younger populations. Although the ageing population may be a marginal category keeping in view the larger media ecology, new media provides the potential to the aged population to be inclusive of urban governance provided they have access and availability. With the help of substantive details, my paper would seek to address the idea of ‘precarity’ associated with the aged population and their way of coping with such precarity with the help of new media in Kolkata. This paper would provide a select reading of samples (qualitative data) from different regions of Kolkata. Through substantive details my paper would provide insights about a vulnerable population, otherwise, neglected in the making of urban governance."

This longitudinal, qualitative study with young Haitians from urban shantytowns combines ethnographic and participatory methods to explore the complexities behind such idioms. Artistic and creative products made by or with the youth facilitated interviews, focus group discussions, and workshops. Through the life stories of participants and rich ethnographic material, this study presents locally situated idioms of resilience (and distress). By including local social ecology, the idioms were framed as historically and culturally rooted, thus shaping contextual, pragmatic, and gendered coping strategies grounded in embodied experiences of vulnerability and resistance. The study adds essential insights into Haitian resilience, revealing the local logics behind seemingly paradoxical statements. By drafting a conceptual framework for further studies on idioms of resilience, the study also makes a theoretical contribution to international resilience research."
Red fox viromes in urban and rural landscapes,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05794da7e2908fcd088436bb0bf9e388fbce3281,Sarah J Campbell; Wilbur Ashley; M. Gil-Fernández; T. Newsome; Francesca Di Giallonardo; Ayda Susana Ortiz-Baez; Jackie E. Mahar; A. Towerton; M. Gillings; E. Holmes; A. Carthey; J. Geoghegan,"Abstract The Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) has established large populations in Australia’s urban and rural areas since its introduction following European settlement. The cryptic and highly adaptable nature of foxes allows them to invade cities and live among humans whilst remaining largely unnoticed. Urban living and access to anthropogenic food resources also influence fox ecology. Urban foxes grow larger, live at higher densities, and are more social than their rural counterparts. These ecological changes in urban red foxes are likely to impact the pathogens that they harbour, and foxes could pose a disease risk to humans and other species that share these urban spaces. To investigate this possibility, we used a meta-transcriptomic approach to characterise the virome of urban and rural foxes across the Greater Sydney region in Australia. Urban and rural foxes differed significantly in virome composition, with rural foxes harbouring a greater abundance of viruses compared to their urban counterparts. We identified ten potentially novel vertebrate-associated viruses in both urban and rural foxes, some of which are related to viruses associated with disease in domestic species and humans. These included members of the Astroviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Hepeviridae, and Picornaviridae as well as rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus-2. This study sheds light on the viruses carried by urban and rural foxes and emphasises the need for greater genomic surveillance of foxes and other invasive species at the human–wildlife interface."
EXAMINATION OF CAMPUS IN TERMS OF ECOLOGICAL LANDSCAPE DESIGN CRITERIA: KTU KANUNI CAMPUS,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/057cf094956b39d9af2c12efc51226a2fde49a96,Mahmut M. Bayramoglu; Seyhan Seyhan; Elif Bayramoğlu,"Today's cities face many problems, such as excessive population growth, environmental pollution, transportation, housing, economy, climate change, and natural disasters due to rapid urbanization. Due to these problems, the nature-human relationship in cities is also deteriorating. To regulate this relationship, it is necessary to create healthy and livable cities by integrating practical resources, energy, and water use with nature. At this point, ecological design criteria emerge in urban planning. Ecological design criteria create nature-friendly designs within the city. By providing energy and resource conservation in urban areas, it creates spaces that are close to nature and climate-friendly. At this point, many areas are suitable for ecological design in cities. University campuses are also suitable places for determining and implementing ecological design criteria. Campuses are areas where academic activities are carried out and also offer essential living spaces where environmental sustainability can be ensured. Therefore, campuses must be designed in line with ecological criteria to create a model for city centers. At this point, one of the campuses that is ecologically self-sufficient produces and uses its energy and offers sustainable solutions to increasing environmental problems, which is examined within the scope of the study. Thus, the KTÜ Kanuni campus, located within the borders of Trabzon City, was selected as the study area. The current situation of the study area was evaluated according to ecological design criteria. Thus, the importance of how much university campuses' current potential contributes to a city's sustainability and ecology was emphasized."
Lake ecological evaluation and land use planning in lakeside area from the perspective of two-way interaction,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/058fad43de4a1d003e5700c6d82c43c11d93ca90,Biao Zhang; Junyan Yang; Yi-feng Wu,"The healthy development of the lakeside area needs a detailed assessment of lake ecology and land use, and to adopt a targeted dynamic maintenance strategy. This paper is based on the micro perspective. On the one hand, through the subdivision of land use types in lakeside area, the paper discusses the impact of non-point source (NPS) pollution from different types of land on lake ecology. On the other hand, the paper studies the impact of water environmental capacity and water ecological health assessment on lakeside area construction. From a two-way perspective, we can unify the two as a whole, and jointly promote the healthy development of the lakeside area. Studies have shown that the construction of lakeside area needs to control scale and land use types to meet the needs of water ecological protection. The 2-levels, 5-categories, and 17-subcategories of the lake ecological health assessment index can provide effective support for dynamic monitoring and optimization and adjustment of planning strategies. Lakeside area developing is a dynamic and gradual process. The paper provides a feasible method to realize lake ecological protection and urban development."
Urbanizzazione planetaria e Covid-19: Nuove geografie per convivere con la natura?,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0593a2131a6026bb12ed0c08585de4f70a0390db,Luca Bertocci; Giordano Panosetti; Tommaso Pirone; Giacomo Spanu,"In this paper we suggest that, to approach the actual urban configurations, we are in need of new geographies. To critically understand the production of socio natural space we propose two methods: Planetary Urbanization and World Ecology. Consistent with the ongoing debate in Urban Political Ecology, we approach the Covid-19 pandemic as a result of the ecological crisis which is, as we show, an urban crisis. In order to immagine new methods of living with and within nature, we suggest to go beyond the normative dichotomies developed by the Capitalistic culture. Considering this problem, we approac h to the urbanization as a multiscalar and uneven process, with a specific attention on public spaces (common), mobility (daily or wide ranging) and the relationship between infrastructures and nature (the Mapuche case)."
"Molecular Characterization and Distribution of Malaria Vectors in three Agrarian Communities of Kano State, North West Nigeria",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05954387e56cd41720dda49110257fd15f53723f,F. Darda; M. Eluma; T. Oyeniyi; Samson Awolola; Georgina Mwansat; N. Nanvyat; Jael Asabe Yohanna,"Malaria vector abundance has been linked to certain agricultural practices. This work examined the impact of the agricultural practice of irrigation on the composition and seasonal distribution of malaria vectors in agrarian communities of Kano state. Longitudinal data collection was done four times a year, corresponding to different transmission seasons from early rains to late rainy season, early dry season to late dry season. Indoor-biting adult mosquitoes were collected using standard pyrethrum spray collection (PSC) techniques. Female Anopheles mosquitoes collected from houses were morphologically identified to species level. Molecular characterisation of the members of the Anopheles gambiae complex was carried out using PCR technique. Two thousand four hundred fifty-two (2452) adult female Anopheles species were collected throughout the study period. The Large Irrigation (LIC) and Urban Irrigation Communities (UIC) had a higher mean abundance of female Anopheles mosquitoes across seasons. There was a significant difference in the mean adult mosquito catch across the season (F =113.49, p≤0.001) and across the three communities (F = 44.73; p ≤0.001). Anopheles gambiae sl. was the most encountered among the four species, with a mean abundance of 11.94±11.76, 5.39±7.45 and 2.58 ±3.41 for LIC, UIC and NIC, respectively. Molecular characterisation of An. gambiae s.l. by PCR showed the presence of three sibling species, An. coluzzi, An. gambiae ss and An. arabiensis. An. Coluzzi was significantly more abundant across the three communities during the wet and dry seasons. The predominance of this species has implications for malaria control. This study shows that irrigation is likely to influence mosquito breeding, thus exposing community members to a higher risk of being bitten by infected vectors. A review of the ecology of Anopheles species, especially in urban environments, is needed, considering the current abundance of malaria vectors in the urban community.

Falshfasad,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05af2ba62426798f6dd98bd313b2c6d9a58d630d,Michał Murawski,"Zaryadye Park is an extravagant landscaping project–cum–multimedia attraction that opened in 2017 adjacent to Moscow’s Kremlin. This article opens with a short reflection on the portents of war legible, with the benefit of hindsight, in Zaryadye’s design. It navigates the thicket of aesthetics, ideologies, ecologies, and economies blossoming in Zaryadye, interrogating propagandistic characterizations of it as an ethereal terrain where infrastructure is altogether displaced by emotion, leisure, spectacle, and nature. Zaryadye has its Muscovite specificities, but it is merely one incarnation of a globally emergent architectural ideology—pseudo-ecological, infrastructure-disavowing—which I call “wild capitalist.” Looking for the locus of Zaryadye’s really existing infrastructure(s), this article peers behind its falshfasady (false facades)—oversized tarps camouflaging the unsightly “reality” of construction work in 21st-century Moscow. Methodologically, the article makes the case for a Marxist ethnographic realism as a suitable lens for depicting reality-in-motion in the wild-capitalist moment. [infrastructure, architecture, postsocialism, fakeness, Marxism, materialism, realism, Moscow, Russia] T his article was accepted for publication in American Ethnologist on February 16, 2022. On February 24, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, unleashing a brutal war that, in a matter of weeks, killed tens of thousands of people and displaced over 10 million. The portents of this war were always evident in my field site, Moscow’s Zaryadye Park, which heaves with more-or-less latent themes of fascism and militarized imperial yearning. These portents are drenched with incompatible, contradictory symbolism and ideological messaging: Soviet and tsarist, Luddite and futurist, bellicose and bucolic. They are too many to list here, but some are legible in this article’s ethnographic descriptions. At the core of my analysis is an attempt to make sense of the purported “fakeness” of Zaryadye, nicknamed Putin’s paradise (putinskiy rai) by skeptical Muscovites. What does this “fakeness” say about vernacular and ethnographic theoretical understandings of “reality,” and what, if any, actually existing realities do the “false facades” of Zaryadye conceal? In my analysis, I identify labor as the critical infrastructure disavowed by contemporary Moscow’s escapist leisurescapes. In the wake of current events, however, it has become clear that, in the last instance, the “reality” of Russia’s “wild capitalist” 21st century—a reality at once thinly obfuscated and deafeningly amplified by Zaryadye’s eco-imperialist shrubbery—is the inevitability of war.

The birch grove in Zaryadye Park, Moscow, September 2017. (Michał Murawski) [This figure appears in color in the online issue] Introduction: On the other side of the fence “They don’t treat us as badly here as on other construction sites,” says Akhmad, a foreman from Dagestan, “because Putin is right over there, on the other side of the fence.”1 The fence Akhmad refers to is the iconic, 15thcentury redbrick Kremlin fortress wall, on the other side of Zaryadye Park, a few hundred meters from the edge of the gorodok (lit. “small town”), or temporary workers’ encampment. Akhmad is standing outside a bytovka, a containerlike building that consists of offices, equipment stores, and (unofficial) accommodation for workers. The gorodok is composed of dozens of bytovki, set in a muddy landscape strewn with garbage, broken glass, and construction debris. The encampment lies next to Zaryadye Park (see Figure 1), a flagship new public space–cum–multimedia attraction in the heart of old Moscow, adjacent to the Kremlin and Red Square, whose opening in September 2017 was officiated by Russian president Vladimir Putin. On a subsequent visit, another worker, a lighting specialist from western Russia, tells us that the most interesting thing about Zaryadye is not in fact the park, but the gorodok itself—“the shit in which the workers live.” Besides the fortress wall, several other permanent barriers separate the gorodok from the Kremlin—the most immediate one being the weathered cast-iron fence of the derelict Soviet military academy within whose perimeter the workers’ encampment is located. The gorodok’s slumlike conditions are tightly sealed from view, however, because the fence is hung edge to edge with luscious renderings of the completed park, printed on giant falshfasady— plastic banners, frequently used in Moscow to conceal the messy infrastructure (and labor) of construction or repair work (see Figure 2).2 Zaryadye occupies a 40-hectare plot vacated in 2004, when the city demolished the gargantuan late-Soviet hulk of the Hotel Rossiya. The new park is the flagship element of the city government’s audacious campaign of blagoustroistvo, or comprehensive public space modernization and beautification, which has been underway with gathering intensity since the 2010s.3 The falshfasad has become one of the icons of blagoustroistvo, especially in its distinctive green-white striped variety (designed in 2016 by the “urban consultancy” bureau KB Strelka), reminiscent of Soviet-era beach windbreaks and deck chairs (see Figure 3). For Muscovites, the falshfasad’s pervasive and unceasing distribution throughout the city has become an object of fascination—and mockery. In December 2017, a few weeks after our visit to the gorodok, an elite group of Muscovites—architects, critics, public intellectuals—sat down in front of another (very grubby) green-white striped falshfasad, installed in a contemporary art gallery, to debate architecture and ideology.

Falshfasady—featuring renderings of the completed Zaryadye Park—on the fence of the workers’ gorodok, October 2017. (Michał Murawski) [This figure appears in color in the online issue] Timur Bashkaev, a prominent Moscow architect, who had helped design Zaryadye together with the project’s lead designers, the New York–based firm Diller Scodifio+Renfro (DS+R). Standing in front of a falshfasad, Bashkaev delivered a pean to infrastructurelessness, marveling at how Zaryadye constituted a space, he said, devoid of infrastructure and devoted only to the sphere of affect, spectacle, and enjoyment. In this, he noted, Zaryadye resembles its New York progenitor, the High Line, DS+R’s signature project: [The High Line] triggers emotions [. . .] and that’s it, there’s nothing else there [. . .] no communication, no transport, no nothing. [. . .] And so Zaryadye, its main task [. . .] [is to] trigger enormous positive emotions [. . .] colossal “wow effects.” This article tells the story of both sides of the falshfasad: the rai (paradise) on the “right” side, a luscious terrain conjuring an affect of ethereal infrastructurelessness, and the govno (shit) on the “wrong” side, which I conceptually identify as the location of the park’s disavowed but indispensable (infrareal) infrastructure. Of course, the distinction between the two sides is anything but absolute, and Moscow’s falshfasady themselves play a mediating role, speaking to and hinting at connections and (dis)continuities between the realities they demarcate. The falshfasad, and its social effect, are themselves marked by ambivalence. On the one hand, the falshfasad functions as it is intended: to conceal the gritty process of infrastructural transformation; to connote an atmosphere of sensory pleasure and laborfree leisureliness; and to insinuate that the city—as explicitly claimed by the ideologues of blagoustroistvo (Revzin 2019)—is being turned into a year-round kurort (vacation resort), a paradisiacal zone of sensual indulgence and vacation-like leisure. On the other hand, through its distinctive appearance, its ubiquity in the urban landscape, the long-term inconvenience it signals, and its increasingly bedraggled, be-holed, graffiti-laden appearance, the falshfasad draws attention to the very fact that it thinly veils something and someone: the camouflaged infrastructure of foundation pits, bytovki, gorodki, and the hard labor of migrants on which depend the infrastructureless resort-ness, emotion-scapes, and “wow effects” of Putin’s paradise.4 The ethnographic material on which my analysis is grounded was collected during 18 months of fieldwork in Moscow in 2017–18. I conducted some fieldwork alone and some in collaboration with students and colleagues at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics, as well as with a larger group of artists and curators who established an unofficial Institute of Zaryadyology. We embarked on collective field trips into the park and Moscow beyond, and we organized over a dozen public and private 3 151425, 0, D ow nlad"

Woldoff; L. M. Morrison,"Abstract Recent debates question whether assemblage urbanism provides an appropriate framework for addressing the housing question under late capitalism. On one side, proponents note the capacity of assemblage to reveal the complex emergence of events, places and processes, whereas critics argue assemblage accounts provide deep empirical detail but avoid engaging with political economy. This paper addresses such criticism through an assemblage account of local activism in the context of ownership changes that threatened the rent-regulated Stuyvesant Town neighbourhood in Manhattan. We adopt an assemblage methodology to examine this case of privileged tenant activism and find that it provides an additive lens for understanding the networks of relations that influenced the community during the mid-2000s. Noting that assemblage and the financial ecologies approach are similar in their attendance to relational thinking, we describe how these approaches can be used in conjunction to better understand the linkages between housing and financialization."
Waste and Urban Environmental Crisis in Cochin: the Case of Brahmapuram Landfill,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05ea72588452ec8fb9d5bc7d5b5d83eb4d19c2a3,Justin Mathew,"In urban context, solid waste management is not merely a question of bureaucratic efficiency but a deeply political issue, entangled in various forms of socio-environmental contradictions. In Cochin, a major port city and industrial urban space in Southwest India, the issue of urban waste circulation intersects with urban land commodification, industrialisation of leisure, water management, and urban planning. Government-led urban waste management programmes, especially the clean city initiatives, promote hygienic urban citizenship through intensive campaigns, moral appeals to reduce waste production, and educational efforts targeting waste collection and processing works. The existing studies on the issues of urban waste production and landfill focuses on the administrative spaces of the cities. This study analyses the politics of urban waste through the theoretical lens of environmental history and political ecology. By analysing the debates and movements related to the Brahmapuram landfill, the article argues that the ‘green city’ initiatives contributes to the elimination and dispossession of marginalised social groups – including peasants, fishers, and migrant workers - as well as the degradation of ecologically sensitive areas such as backwaters, rivers and marshlands. By adopting multi-scalar geographical frames of analysis, this paper argues that solid waste management is not limited to a city. The study carried out qualitative field visits to understand the complex spatialities of waste production and circulation in the context of Cochin. Informed by the concept of urban social metabolism concept, this paper argues that the production, circulation and the processing of waste constitutes a geographically extended urban process. This process, in turn, generates precarious environments for people located outside of visible boundaries of the city. The research underscores the need to frame urban waste production and circulation as a question of the right to the city and the right to sustain indigenous modes of life, which are increasingly getting toxified. In doing so, it challenges the commodification landforms as mere landfills spaces and proposes an alternative discourse on the issues of the right of everyone to access the city as non-commodified nature."

Heidkamp; A. Christian,"Land use land cover within a watershed influences stream water quality, habitat quality, and biological community structure. As development and associated impervious surface increases in a watershed, changes in storm water and nutrient inputs generally cause declines in habitat conditions and biodiversity. The first goal of our study was to evaluate the water quality in the Charles River watershed, in which our objective (G1O1) was to establish ten 100-meter reach-scale sampling stations and conduct physical, chemical, and biological assessments. The second goal of this study was to better understand the direct and indirect effects of hierarchical variables on water quality in the Charles River watershed. Our first objective of our second goal (G2O1) was to calculate land use land cover percentages at the pour-point subwatershed and local 100-meter buffer scale for each of our ten 100-meter reach sampling stations. Our second objective of our second goal (G2O2) was to use path analysis to determine the direct and indirect effects of land use land cover and impervious surface on water quality in the Charles River watershed. The results of G1O1 were that habitat quality assessments ranged from “marginal” to “optimal” and biological quality assessments ranged from “fair” to “good“, indicating overall “fair” or better water quality conditions in the watershed. The results of G2O2 were that our path analysis resulted in differences in effects of development between the buffer and sub-watershed scale. At the buffer scale, water quality was influenced more negatively by the percentage of developed land area versus the percentage of impervious cover. While both buffer development and habitat quality had a direct effect on Streamside Biosurvey Macroinvertebrates, buffer development also directly hindered habitat quality, thus having an indirect effect on Streamside Biosurvey Macroinvertebrates through habitat. Streamside Biosurvey Macroinvertebrate scores were shown to be more sensitive to development within the buffer versus at the sub-watershed scale, where impervious cover was a more important indicator of stream water quality. Through this small case study of 10 stations within the Charles River watershed, we illustrated how citizen-science level water quality assessments can be combined with water chemistry and hierarchical LULC data to provide insights into potential direct and indirect effects on water quality. As the fields of landscape ecology and conservation continue to grow, so does our ability to determine changes in land development and devise management strategies aimed at improving water quality."

Hemming-Schroeder; Guo-hui Yi; Fengyang Fu; Faxing Fu; L. Cui; G. Cui; G. Yan,"Background Mosquitoes are vectors of many tropical diseases. Understanding the ecology of local mosquito vectors, such as species composition, distributions, population dynamics, and species diversity is important for designing the optimal strategy to control the mosquito-borne diseases. Methods Entomological surveillance of adult mosquitoes was conducted in five sites representing different ecological settings across Hainan Island from January to December of 2018 using BG Sentinel (BGS) traps and Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) light traps. In each site, we selected three areas representing urban, suburban and rural settings. Eighteen trap-days were sampled in each setting at each site, and CDC light traps and BGS traps were setup simultaneously. Mosquito species composition, distribution, population dynamics, and species diversity were analyzed. Mosquito densities were compared between different study sites and between different settings. Results Nine species of mosquitoes belonging to four genera were identified. Culex quinquefasciatus (80.8%), Armigeres subalbatus (13.0%) and Anopheles sinensis (3.1%) were the top three species collected by CDC light traps; Cx. quinquefasciatus (91.9%), Ae. albopictus (5.1%), and Ar. subalbatus (2.8%) were the top three species collected by BGS traps. Predominant species varied among study sites. The population dynamics of Ae. albopictus , An. sinensis and Cx. quinquefasciatus showed clear seasonal variation regardless of study sites with a varied peak season for different species. Mosquito abundance of all species showed significant differences among different study sites and among urban, suburban and rural areas. Danzhou had the highest mosquito biodiversity, with an α, β, and Gini-Simpson biodiversity index of 8, 1.13 and 0.42, respectively. BGS traps captured Aedes mosquito at a higher efficiency than CDC light traps, whereas CDC light traps captured significantly more Anopheles and Armigeres mosquitoes than BGS traps. Conclusions Mosquitoes were abundant on Hainan Island with clear seasonality and spatial heterogeneity. Population density, species composition, distribution, and species diversity were strongly affected by the natural environment. Different tools are required for the surveillance of different mosquito species."
How urban proximity shapes agricultural pest dynamics: a review,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/062968b00af1d1e5c2cd77c74e511e15ad0717c7,L. Blank,"Agricultural landscapes adjacent to human settlements are subject to unique ecological dynamics that influence pest populations, yet the complexity of these relationships remains relatively underexplored. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the impacts of urban proximity on agricultural plant pathogen pest dynamics, focusing on spatial distribution patterns, theoretical frameworks from landscape ecology, and the specific mechanisms driving these interactions. The urban heat island effect, habitat fragmentation, and human activities contribute to altered microclimates, reduced natural predator populations, and increased pest proliferation near settlements. Additionally, regulatory constraints on pest control near human communities further complicate management efforts. The role of urban environments as potential sources of agricultural pests is analyzed through empirical case studies, highlighting both predictable patterns and varying outcomes depending on specific local conditions. Gaps in understanding the movement of pests across urban–agricultural boundaries are discussed, alongside recommendations for future research aimed at enhancing pest control strategies in these complex landscapes. © 2025 The Author(s).

 This paper is concerned with the study of ecology and invasive behaviour of southern tropical invaders (Egeria densa, Pistia stratiotes, Eichornia crassipes) in the setting of urban landscape water bodies with a temperate climate (the case of Kyiv, Ukraine). The article explores the role of a city as a source of invasions. It shows that escape from aquaculture (aquariums or decorative ponds) or deliberate release into natural water bodies are the main settlement solution. A brief historical background of these species found in water bodies of Ukraine has been presented. Favourable treatment for modern invasions of pantropical species has been analysed. Phytocoenotic special aspects of the communities formed by these species and ways and possibilities of naturalization of species in natural water bodies have been explored. Production indicators are being analysed."

Materials and methods We examined the gross pathology of 1598 human skeletons from Xingfulindai (AD 618 to AD 1279) archeological site located on the Central Plain of China. Using the modified diagnostic criteria defined by Hackett's classical work, we classify the pathology as consistent, strongly suggestive, or pathognomonic for treponemal infection. Results Twelve adult individuals from Xingfulindai had bone lesions suggestive of systemic pathology. Two of these individuals displayed a combination of lesion patterns pathognomonic of treponemal disease and one had lesions consistent with treponematosis. The radiocarbon dates for the bone samples from these skeletons place them before AD 1200. Conclusions The location of Xingfulindai in a continental climatic zone is not typical for yaws and bejel ecology, because these strains occur in the tropics, or in hot, dry environments, respectively. The urban setting, where there is documented evidence for increased interaction between multiple ethnic groups and a developed institution of courtesans during the Tang dynasty, favors sexually transmitted syphilis as the more likely diagnosis. This study supports an earlier spread of syphilis to China than 1498."
"Development of Community Tourism in Na Hang District, Tuyen Quang Province, Vietnam Associated With the Protection of Special- Use Forests",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0634ed9501bee61e6ec086dc608e7838f29ff1ed,Pham Thi Huyen Trang,"Community-based tourism is currently a popular trend of developing countries, including Vietnam. After the Covid 19 pandemic, most of the travel needs of tourists have changed. From bustling urban areas, tourists want to find remote areas to be close to nature, find inner peace and enjoy a green life. Therefore, community-based tourism in the form of experience, adventure, ecology and healing is being prioritized for development in Tuyen Quang province. This is a province with the largest natural forest cover in Vietnam, in which, Na Hang district has over 21,000 hectares of natural forest in Thanh Tuong, Son Phu, Con Lon and Khau Tinh communes. In order to better manage and protect forests, over the past time, Na Hang Special-use Forest Protection Department has strengthened propaganda, patrolling, controlling and protecting existing forest areas, contributing to preserving the living environment, natural disaster prevention, socio-economic promotion, tourism development. The issue of special-use forest protection associated with community-based tourism development has both created livelihoods for the people here and raised people’s awareness of preserving the landscape environment."
"Relative Influence of Land Use, Mosquito Abundance, and Bird Communities in Defining West Nile Virus Infection Rates in Culex Mosquito Populations",2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/063a53a5ce5fee788fafa5a04b204c52e87a1e22,J. Adelman; Ryan E Tokarz; Alec E. Euken; Eleanor N. Field; Marie C. Russell; Ryan C. Smith,"Simple Summary West Nile virus (WNV) is transmitted by mosquitoes and maintained in bird populations. However, it is less clear why some geographic locations consistently serve as “hotspots” for increased WNV transmission. To address this question, we examined land use as well as mosquito and bird community metrics at sites across central Iowa. Our data suggest that WNV activity in mosquitoes is most heavily influenced by the abundance of Culex pipiens group mosquitoes during late summer, with landscape ecology having less defined impacts. Our data also suggest that bird community metrics have little influence on WNV infections in mosquitoes. Together, these results provide new information on the ecological and host factors that most heavily influence WNV transmission. Abstract Since its introduction to North America in 1999, the West Nile virus (WNV) has resulted in over 50,000 human cases and 2400 deaths. WNV transmission is maintained via mosquito vectors and avian reservoir hosts, yet mosquito and avian infections are not uniform across ecological landscapes. As a result, it remains unclear whether the ecological communities of the vectors or reservoir hosts are more predictive of zoonotic risk at the microhabitat level. We examined this question in central Iowa, representative of the midwestern United States, across a land use gradient consisting of suburban interfaces with natural and agricultural habitats. At eight sites, we captured mosquito abundance data using New Jersey light traps and monitored bird communities using visual and auditory point count surveys. We found that the mosquito minimum infection rate (MIR) was better predicted by metrics of the mosquito community than metrics of the bird community, where sites with higher proportions of Culex pipiens group mosquitoes during late summer (after late July) showed higher MIRs. Bird community metrics did not significantly influence mosquito MIRs across sites. Together, these data suggest that the microhabitat suitability of Culex vector species is of greater importance than avian community composition in driving WNV infection dynamics at the urban and agricultural interface."
INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF «GREEN» ROOFS USING SIMULATION CALCULATIONS ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE CITY OF TULA,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06412c22e31234b573f554da09b01a6e0074fc64,A. Lapin; E. Sysoeva,"Environmental issues in large, including industrial cities of Russia, are acute, since the execution of production processes and simultaneous control over the well-being of the environment is a complex multifactorial aspect that requires careful study and elaboration. In addition, there is a sharp shortage of public green spaces in many territories, which are regulated by legislation and are designed to increase the environmental comfort of citizens. In densely populated cities, the issue of providing residents with green spaces is accompanied by a lack of free space, «green roofs» are able to solve this problem without taking up additional space in the city, compactly placed on the roofs of existing buildings, while increasing the commercial attractiveness of objects and preserving the enclosing multilayer coating system. The article considers a brief historical background of the development of the technology of «green» roofs in the world and in Russia, provides examples of modern buildings and structures actively using this technology, explains the general structure of the modern «green» roof in the context of the current regulatory documentation. The collection and analysis of data on the example of the Tula region concerning demographic, social and environmental indicators for correlation calculation was carried out. Graphs and polynomial trend lines of various environmental factors are constructed, determination coefficients and functions of trend lines are determined. A correlation matrix is compiled, conclusions are drawn about the possible improvement of the ecology of the urban architectural environment. A regression analysis was performed with statistical results entered into a tabular form. Based on the function obtained as a result of regression analysis, simulation modeling of the population was carried out, taking into account the increase in the area of green spaces of general use"

Crossing the Maelstrom: New Departures in Viking Archaeology,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/065a058af37c1688b967d22be7bef72076a10637,Julie Lund; S. Sindbæk,"This paper reviews the achievements and challenges of archaeological research on Viking Age northern Europe and explores potential avenues for future research. We identify the reemergence of comparative and cross-cultural perspectives along with a turn toward studying mobility and maritime expansion, fueled by the introduction of biomolecular and isotopic data. The study of identity has seen a shift from a focus on collective beliefs and ritual to issues of personal identity and presentation, with a corresponding shift in attention to individual burials and the “animated objects.” Network ontologies have brought new perspectives on the emergence of sea trade and urban nodes and to the significance of outfield production and resources. Field archaeology has seen an emphasis on elite manors, feasting halls, and monuments, as well as military sites and thing assembly places, using new data from remote sensing, geophysical surveys, geoarchaeology, and metal detectors. Concerns over current climate change have placed the study of environment as a key priority, in particular in the ecologically vulnerable North Atlantic settlements. Discussing future directions, we call for alignment between societal/economic and individual/cultural perspectives, and for more ethically grounded research. We point to diaspora theory and intersectionality as frameworks with the potential to integrate genomics, identity, and society, and to ecology as a framework for integrating landscape, mobility, and political power."

From a spatial point of view, this type of relationship often represents a contrast between the urban fabric and the quasi-natural fabric. However, in the regulatory or strategy instruments for the development of urban settlements, where such contrasts exist, they are only integrated at the border level. The ecotone is, in most cases, the only element mentioned in urban planning instruments and is approached as a land that can only function in isolation and that in no way can support urban development. This reluctance and fear of approaching natural protected areas, also negatively influences the conception of the community, investors and the administration. Urban actors are not informed and therefore not motivated, but neither do they have the opportunity to get involved in the conservation and protection process. The purpose of this article is to research urban and biodiversity strategies at E.U level, to identify gaps in the formulation of urban planning tools, what are the reasons behind generating these gaps and how they can be eliminated, or at least mitigated. The analysis will focus on some models of urban strategies which address natural protected areas, but will also consider related elements, directly related to their conservation, urban ecology and the involvement in the process of urban actors."

So far, biotope maps study was a tendency to focus on the type of vegetation, naturalness, land use, landscape ecology theories. However, biotope related studies have not reflected the concept of animal habitat, which is a component of biotope, and that is the limitation of biotope map research. This study suggest a methodology to predict potential habitats for fauna using machine learning to quantify habitat values. The potential habitats of fauna were predicted by spatial statistics using machine learning, and the results were converted into species richness. For biotope type assessments, we classified biotope values into vegetation value and habitat value and evaluated them using a matrix for value summation. The vegetation value was divided into 5 stages based on"
Hypernatural Piedmont prairies: a screening process for optimum placement,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/069e09a431922f4ee8485b84abbea51df1c3a6a8,S. Dunlap; Brad Davis; J. Calabria,"ABSTRACT:Limited information is available on the optimum placement of designed plant communities that reference the historic Piedmont prairies of southeastern North America. Characterized as “a hybrid of horticulture and ecology,” a designed plant communities approach looks to naturally occurring plant associations for both aesthetic inspiration and guidance on ideal environmental conditions and plant composition. Designed plant communities are not intended to be facsimiles of native plant communities and are not ecological restorations. Through semi-novel plant combinations and plant selection aimed at creating vibrant multi-season bloom events for continual visual interest, these hypernatural plantings emphasize public enjoyment. Through the incorporation of the plants’ natural tendencies, however, designed plant communities can also provide ease of maintenance in tough environments and various ecological benefits. This study was conducted to identify optimum locations for the installation of hypernatural Piedmont prairie plantings in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia. Using ArcMap, the authors employed an exclusion and screening process based on the environmental factors identified in literature related to the restoration of natural Piedmont prairies, in addition to logistics related to their implementation within Athens-Clarke County (with appropriate locations limited to public or institutional properties). Appropriate variables were selected and combined to map candidate sites. The process identified 128 ha (318 ac) for hypernatural Piedmont prairie conversion in the county. Suitable locations range from dense urban areas to outlying rural parcels and included power line easements, open parklands, and roadsides. The process was designed to be easily replicated for other Piedmont locations where hypernatural Piedmont prairie plantings are desired."
Butyl Benzyl Phthalate in Urban Sewage by Magnetic-Based Immunoassay: Environmental Levels and Risk Assessment,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06a8bb5303db7b09cecc5ccfa200d339c241a746,Xia Hong; Yin Cui; Ming Li; Yifan Xia; D. Du; C. Yi,"A magnetic-based immunoassay (MBI) combined with biotin-streptavidin amplification was proposed for butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) investigation and risk assessment. The values of LOD (limit of detection, IC10) and IC50 were 0.57 ng/mL and 119.61 ng/mL, with a detection range of 0.57–24,977.71 ng/mL for MBI. The specificity, accuracy and precision are well demonstrated. A total of 36 environmental water samples of urban sewage from Zhenjiang, China, were collected and assessed for BBP contamination. The results show that BBP-positive levels ranged from 2.47 to 89.21 ng/mL, with a positive rate of 77.8%. The health effects of BBP in the urban sewage were within a controllable range, and the ambient severity for health (ASI) was below 1.49. The highest value of AS for ecology (ASII) was 7.43, which indicates a potential harm to ecology. The entropy value of risk quotient was below 100, the highest being 59.47, which poses a low risk to the environment and ecology, indicating that there is a need to strengthen BBP controls. The non-carcinogenic risk of BBP exposure from drinking water was higher for females than that for males, and the non-carcinogenic risk from drinking-water and bathing pathways was negligible. This study could provide an alternative method for detecting BBP and essential information for controlling BBP contamination."
A functional trait-based assessment of urban street tree selection for Ethiopia,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06b186108421f9aa6df18c9224eacd8337036098,G. Tamene; Henrik Sjöman; Åsa Ode Sang; Kumelachew Yeshitla; Birhanu Belay; Ergua Tesfaye; Anna Levinsson,"Urbanization in Ethiopia is rapidly reducing green space and biodiversity, and placing ecological stress on trees. Urban street trees (UST) can provide multiple ecosystem services, but need to cope with challenging street ecology and future climate risks. However, UST selection in Ethiopia is poor, and conventional trials and modern breeding are costly and time consuming to apply in Ethiopia. The main objective of the study was to identify potential UST species for two Ethiopian cities; Addis Ababa, and Arba Minch, by studying interspecific differences in functional traits. For the purpose, we created a database with list of 120 candidate UST gathered from multi-stakeholder workshop, literature review, and senior experts survey, and their ecological with their phenological and morphological features. Then we filtered 25 potential UST through framework analysis considering eco-morphological features of the trees. For the 25 species, we measured three types of plant functional traits: conservative traits (leaf mass per area and leaf dry matter content), acquisitive traits (leaf area, specific leaf area and leaf water content) and drought tolerance traits (leaf turgor pressure loss point, and leaf succulence index). Our results showed a strong trade-off between conservative and acquisitive traits, particularly between leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) (r = −0.71), consistent with plant economic spectrum theory. Using PCA analysis, we identified three groups of potential USTs (Type I, II and III) that exhibit different adaptation strategies, consistent with Grime’s trait-based classification of universal plant adaptation strategies (CSR). Compared to species with high acquisitive traits (Type II and Type III), Type I species have high conservative and drought-tolerant traits shows better adaptation to harsh road environments, whereas Type II and Type III species may be more advantageous for urban parks and other resource-rich components of urban ecology. We also found significant variation in conservative, acquisitive and drought-tolerant traits among different species, indicating their different adaptation strategies. Our research advances the knowledge of plant adaptation in urban environments and provides a useful method for UST selection."

ABSTRACT Among countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Chile stands out as having important inequalities in income distribution, dietary quality, access to urban green spaces, and health outcomes. People in lower socioeconomic groups consistently show higher rates of noncommunicable chronic diseases and are being hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. These chronic conditions are increasingly considered to be shaped, or affected by, the human gut microbiome. Moreover, inequity as an overarching concept might also be associated with microbial patterns and if so, this may represent a novel pathway through which to address health and other disparities. Focusing on the case of Chile, our goal is to contribute to a critical discussion and motivate researchers and policymakers to consider the role of the microbiome in social equity in future endeavors."
Problematizing infrastructural “fixes”: critical perspectives on technocratic approaches to Green Infrastructure,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06bdadc5bccfba3671726678c39874379fec2d3a,L. Diep; P. Parikh; D. Dodman; Juliana Alencar; J. Martins,"ABSTRACT
 This paper analyzes the concept of Green Infrastructure (GI) in urban context, challenging the extent to which it can support a transition towards more socially inclusive forms of urban governance. It builds on the argument that the false promise of “win-wins” in the conceptualization of urban greening participates in the creation of blind spots in practice. Using the case of São Paulo, we bring attention to techno-managerial patterns within top-down governance structures. A political ecology lens helps to analyze power relations at play in the context of a linear park project implemented in an informal settlement. It reveals how current urban governance structures create barriers to the practice of GI, notably because projects often remain incomplete, but also because participatory processes often remain limited. The practice of GI normalized as a technical-rational endeavor leaves limited space for “non-expert” knowledge. Complex settings where intertwined socio-environmental issues cause conflicts over space demand equally complex efforts that go beyond infrastructural “fixes”. To support the institutionalization of GI, a fuller and grounded “translation” process of the concept needs to be supported by forms of urban expertise centered on communities’ needs and local dynamics. We argue that only then will GI support the democratization of urban planning."

K. Sumbo; J. K. Wulifan,"Persistent reduction in urban green spaces in rapidly growing African cities compromises ecosystem services critical to urban resilience and health. Anchored with urban resilience and salutogenesis, this research examined the role of trees preserved in large urban parcels in promoting urban ecology in Wa. The study adopted a mixed-methods approach, with quantitative analysis on the values of the trees and interviews conducted with property managers, residents and workers of the sites to understand their perspectives. I-tree canopy interface was used for quantitative data processing whereas the qualitative data was transcribed from voice recordings and analysed thematically. The findings illustrate that the preserved trees contribute substantially to carbon, air pollution and hydrological benefits. The total carbon (sequestered annually= 169.55kT, stored = 4257.82kT) benefits alone from both sites amounted to 4427.37kT. Overall monetary value from carbon, air pollution, and hydrological benefits for site B (land size =133ac; tree cover=62.43%) was $874,400≈Gh₵14,864,800. This is more than twice the value for site A ($433,178, land size=71.26ac; tree cover = 57.74%), with the two summing up to $1,307,578≈Gh₵22,228,826 (land area=204.26 ac≈1.29% of land in the Township; value produced≈7% of that of the Township) relative to the $18,659,944≈Gh₵317,219,048 for the entire Wa Township (land area=15,808ac). The trees preserved within the study sites enhance biodiversity, provide habitats for fauna and preserve indigenous plant species while offering several economic, socio-cultural and health benefits albeit with certain challenges. The research contributes to the nexus between neo-customary land holding and urban ecology."
Million Trees for Warsaw: Managing pollution crisis through green renewal,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06d2da967394f5ee2227ba9de8482cbce3d113b7,J. Hrckova,"The article proposes the notion of a “spectacle of repair,” a carefully calibrated social technology of green governance aimed at managing the environmental degradation through control over images in Warsaw, Poland. Using case studies Million Trees for Warsaw project and a candidacy for the Green Capital of Europe and building on political ecology literature that addresses the rise of new opportunities for capitalist expansion through restoration activity, this article claims that the production of the green policy sphere allows for a creation of an array of possible “green” actions in the city that are presented as interchangeable and effectively commensurable. As the municipality heavily invests in greenery and a removal of visible signs of messiness and dirt in the city, the depoliticized spectacle of a clean and green urban space focuses on creating an image of the authorities actively combating the pollution as well as working towards making Warsaw more “livable.” At the same time, the two major roots of pollution found in ever-increasing car traffic and old coal-heating systems remain insufficiently addressed amid a lack of political will. The paper argues that mitigation strategy of the city hall thus heavily relies on a management of visibilities; attempting to alleviate the citizens’ pressure to tackle the largely invisible air pollution by delivering the tidy greenery desired by the urban elites, keeping the city fit for competing in the global neoliberal economy."

LST data sources are diverse, with remote sensing being the prevailing means of acquisition. FY-4A/AGRI offers high-quality LST products for East Asia. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation and refined analysis of surface heat resources in Hunan Province, central China, over a two-year period using the 4 km/1 h resolution product in this study. The results demonstrate that the FY-4A LST product effectively captures surface temperature (R = 0.893), albeit with a relatively high error level (Bias = −6.295 °C; RMSE = 8.58 °C), particularly in capturing high LST values. The performance of this product is superior in the eastern flat terrain area of Hunan Province compared to its performance in the western mountainous region due to environmental conditions causing systematic errors that contribute to instability in detection deviation for this product. Surface heat resources are more abundant in eastern Hunan Province than in mountainous areas located west and southwardly, and the detailed distribution of them at finer scales is mainly influenced by terrain and climate conditions. There is no obvious seasonal difference in the distribution of heat resources except in winter, and rapid urbanization within Chang–Zhu–Tan urban agglomeration over two years has significantly altered the spatial distribution pattern of surface heat resources across Hunan Province. These findings provide a quantitative baseline for assessing FY-4A satellite’s detection capability while serving as a reference for further application of its LST products and establishing foundations for divisional classification and utilization strategies pertaining to surface heat resources within Hunan Province."
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Determination in Urban Areas by Full-Spectrum Photography,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06da103011d81817d3603845e1e040f39ea391f6,D. Patón,"(1) Background: The NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is a basic indicator of photosynthetic activity frequently employed in landscape and urban ecology. However, the high-resolution determination of NDVI requires an expensive multi-spectral digital camera. (2) Methods: In the present work, we are developing a general procedure that converts a Nikon D50 into a full-spectrum camera. We also use a red Hoya A25 filter to separate red (R) and infrared (NIR) radiations. Afterward, we calibrate the camera using the reflectance information of a Macbeth Color Checker. Additional procedures include a custom white balance (CWB), histogram equalization and exposure control. (3) Results: Our results indicate high correlations over 90% for R and NIR channels, which allow us to determine the NDVI with precision. Even it is possible to observe the NDVI differences between soil, water, rocks, algae, lichens, shrubs, grasses and trees in different environmental conditions and (4) Conclusions: The methodology described in this work allows a more economical analysis of high-resolution NDVI in landscape and urban areas adapting a modified camera to airborne or drone systems."

At these seminars, Members present work-in-progress and then take questions. There is often lively conversation and debate, some of which will be included with the papers. We have chosen papers we thought would be of interest to a broad audience. Our aim is to capture some part of the cross-disciplinary conversations that are the mark of the School's programs. While Members are drawn from specific disciplines of the social sciences—anthropology, economics, sociology and political science— as well as history, philosophy, literature and law, the School encourages new approaches that arise from exposure to different forms of interpretation. The papers in this series differ widely in their topics, methods, and disciplines. Yet they concur in a broadly humanistic attempt to understand how, and under what conditions, the concepts that order experience in different cultures and societies are produced, and how they change. Nikhil Anand is Assistant Professor of Geography, Environment and Society at the University of Minnesota. His research specializes in the ecology of cities, infrastructure and urbanism. Participating in ongoing conversations around "" planetary urbanization, "" biopolitics, and the unstable futures of public infrastructure, his first book manuscript, "" Infrapolitics: Public Systems and the Social Life of Water in Mumbai, "" explores how settlers overcome the structural exclusions of limited liberal government to claim water in the city.

Alyas; Turki M. Alghamdi; Yazed Alsaawy; Ali Alzahrani,"Smart cities have emerged as a specialized domain encompassing various technologies, transitioning from civil engineering to technology-driven solutions. The accelerated development of technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), software-defined networks (SDN), 5G, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and analytics, has played a crucial role in providing solutions for smart cities. Smart cities heavily rely on devices, ad hoc networks, and cloud computing to integrate and streamline various activities towards common goals. However, the complexity arising from multiple cloud service providers offering myriad services necessitates a stable and coherent platform for sustainable operations. The Smart City Operational Platform Ecology (SCOPE) model has been developed to address the growing demands, and incorporates machine learning, cognitive correlates, ecosystem management, and security. SCOPE provides an ecosystem that establishes a balance for achieving sustainability and progress. In the context of smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT) devices play a significant role in enabling automation and data capture. This research paper focuses on a specific module of SCOPE, which deals with data processing and learning mechanisms for object identification in smart cities.

Gut microbial ecology and exposome of a healthy Pakistani cohort,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06f73f46263f4f3456d9992e8acba7ba4676b1c5,Farzana Gul; H. Herrema; M. Davids; C. Keating; A. Nasir; U. Ijaz; Sundus Javed,"Background Pakistan is a multi-ethnic society where there is a disparity between dietary habits, genetic composition, and environmental exposures. The microbial ecology of healthy Pakistani gut in the context of anthropometric, sociodemographic, and dietary patterns holds interest by virtue of it being one of the most populous countries, and also being a Lower Middle Income Country (LMIC). Methods 16S rRNA profiling of healthy gut microbiome of normo-weight healthy Pakistani individuals from different regions of residence is performed with additional meta-data collected through filled questionnaires. The current health status is then linked to dietary patterns through \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\chi }^{2}$$\end{document}χ2 test of independence and Generalized Linear Latent Variable Model (GLLVM) where distribution of individual microbes is regressed against all recorded sources of variability. To identify the core microbiome signature, a dynamic approach is used that considers into account species occupancy as well as consistency across assumed grouping of samples including organization by gender and province of residence. Fitting neutral modeling then revealed core microbiome that is selected by the environment. Results A strong determinant of disparity is by province of residence. It is also established that the male microbiome is better adapted to the local niche than the female microbiome, and that there is microbial taxonomic and functional diversity in different ethnicities, dietary patterns and lifestyle habits. Some microbial genera, such as, Megamonas, Porphyromonas, Haemophilus, Klebsiella and Finegoldia showed significant associations with consumption of pickle, fresh fruits, rice, and cheese. Our analyses suggest current health status being associated with the diet, sleeping patterns, employment status, and the medical history. Conclusions This study provides a snapshot of the healthy core Pakistani gut microbiome by focusing on the most populous provinces and ethnic groups residing in predominantly urban areas. The study serves a reference dataset for exploring variations in disease status and designing personalized dietary and lifestyle interventions to promote gut health, particularly in LMICs settings.

The Linkage Between Economic Growth and Ecology of Urban Area Development in Indonesia: A Systematic Review,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06fc07a96ec979810937629f2cf885a8e17940ca,Irfan Maulana Ashgaf; Dominicus Anindita Bagaskara Utomo; Susilo Kusdiwanggo,"In this decade there are often disasters and other things of natural damage that have an impact on the lives of the global community. Pollution and disasters are the reasons for the difficulty of realizing sustainable development goals indicators. Rapid economic growth accompanied by large population growth and energy fulfilment needs every year causes a surge in global-scale crises. The industrial area that was formed is also increasingly expanding which cannot be ignored that land use has also changed. In this study, we will examine the relationship between economic growth and ecological conditions in urban development areas in Indonesia. This study uses a qualitative description method with a systematic literature review approach. The findings of this study are that economic growth is a major cause of environmental damage by industrial activity and the expansion of urban development areas. Even so, prevention efforts by examining more deeply each aspect by involving every party, including architecture, to be able to realize sustainable development."

Public Attitudes towards Insect Pollinators in Morocco: Insights from a Pilot Study with Broader Applications,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0716c93cbb2b398ba24ab54f87a12ea9f5587e9a,R. Sabbahi; Insafe El Abdouni; Patrick Lhomme; Omar Boubker; K. Azzaoui; Belkheir Hammouti; M. Neffa; Virginia Hock,"This pilot study provides insights into the Moroccan public’s understanding and willingness to engage in insect pollinator preservation, highlighting widespread awareness alongside significant knowledge gaps. The success of biodiversity conservation efforts, especially those aimed at insect pollinators, is greatly enhanced by an informed and committed populace. Understanding public perceptions of insect pollinators is important as it shapes the effectiveness of conservation strategies and their implementation. Although our pilot study does not include every demographic of Moroccan society, it does include an important portion of the populace: educated urban youth. This is a key portion of the population that will be crucial in developing future conservation strategies, especially given the tendency towards increasing urbanization putting cities at the forefront of sustainable development. Our study aimed to assess opinions on insect pollinators, their services, and their declining population numbers in Morocco. We conducted a survey distributed mainly through the media over four months, receiving responses from 301 individuals. The results indicate that the public is aware of decreasing insect pollinator populations and their main threats, and shows a willingness to participate in conservation strategies. However, gaps persist in understanding the roles and ecology of pollinators. While honey bees and bumble bees are well-recognized for their role in pollinating agricultural and wild plants, there is less awareness about other common pollinators such as solitary bees and flies. Additionally, the essential contributions of non-bee pollinators remain widely overlooked. To address these findings, we recommend implementing specialized educational initiatives to increase public understanding of the vital functions of non-bee pollinators in supporting ecosystem services. In order to adopt a more encompassing strategy for the conservation of insect pollinators, upcoming outreach efforts within the national biodiversity strategy should emphasize the contributions made by lesser-known non-bee insect pollinators and strive to engage sectors of the population currently less involved in pollinator conservation. However, while this pilot study provides valuable insights, the sample size limits the generalizability of these conclusions. Future research with larger and more diverse samples would be beneficial to validate and expand upon these findings in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of all areas of public perception and engagement in pollinator conservation in Morocco. Expanding sampling to include older, less educated, and less urban demographics would strengthen these initial insights and broaden their application, especially beyond urban attitudes."
Democratising Participatory Research: Pathways to Social Justice from the South,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0723be3b68f45e4b8b0371f54060daefda5e537d,Jennifer Rogers-Brown,"study shifted during research. While sometimes resulting in a narrative branching in multiple directions, punctuated by abundant fire and smoke metaphors, the overall approach is refreshing. Rather than reassembling his fieldwork experiences into an artificially neat story, Little conveys how, as an outsider, he came to understand the multiple forces at play in shaping Agbogbloshie. Little’s approach is generative, with each chapter raising important questions about migration, environmental health, urban informality, and global supply chains that connect this place to other parts of the world. Despite the book’s extensive engagement with existing scholarship, some concepts and lines of inquiry would have benefited from more sustained and in-depth attention, especially work on ‘‘Black ecologies’’ as they relate to environmental racism. I was also curious to hear more observations about the experiences of women vendors who work at the market and the relationships between scrap dealers and businessmen higher up the hierarchy. Still, if the main aim of this e-waste ethnography is to ‘‘help us ask better questions’’ (p. 187), the book certainly accomplishes this, as well as offering new ways to think about e-waste and meaningful social change. A new round of demolition at Agbogbloshie took place in July 2021, as government bulldozers razed the scrapyard to prepare for new development. Many workers relocated to their homes in Old Fadama and other sites adjacent to the market (Akese, Beisel, and Chasant 2022). As this story continues, Burning Matters is a timely analysis that will be of interest to scholars and students of waste, environmental studies, environmental sociology, labor, and global inequality."
Citizens’ Assemblies and Democracy,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0735c0174f6dc280eb34bcba644f1cc10ccc33c1,Antonin Lacelle-Webster; Mark E Warren,"Even as most citizens of electoral democracies remain strongly committed to democratic values, most electoral democracies are suffering from democratic deficits that are eroding their legitimacy. There are deficits of inclusion, as elected governments often poorly represent those who are less educated or less wealthy or who belong to ethnic, religious, racial, or other minorities. There are deficits of deliberativeness, as governments fail to learn from experts and everyday citizens alike. And, increasingly, there are deficits of collective capacity, often the result of governments that are gridlocked by polarization and unable to marshal the political resources to address tough problems, such as climate change and migration. Democracies do, however, reinvent themselves, often by supplementing the legacy institutions of electoral democracy with innovative ways of deepening democracy. Among the most promising innovations are citizens’ assemblies, a kind of deliberative minipublic comprised of lay citizens selected through near-random methods to represent a broader public. These bodies are typically tasked with learning and deliberating about a problem and providing recommendations. In contrast to sitting legislatures, citizens’ assemblies are typically convened for a single issue or purpose, and they are closely defined in their mandate. As of 2020, there were over 20 cases of citizens’ assemblies, covering a range of issues (e.g., electoral reform, climate change, abortion, and urban planning), enabling some generalization about their capacities and promise. Owing to their high degree of representativeness of ordinary citizens, their capacities to learn and deliberate, and their abilities to break through difficult or gridlocked issues, citizens’ assemblies have considerable promise to address democratic deficits and to deepen democracy when they are carefully inserted into the political ecologies of modern democracies."
The determination of green open space (GOS) in Palu based on total population and area,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0735f3d62b0441d7c9c26d96541f0838eb24ae9b,P. Astutiek; A. Chaerul; F. Julia,"Green Open Space (GOS) is the most important factor of a city formation structure. Green open space is very much needed around the downtown area due to its function that supports the ecology of a city. The quality of environment are becoming healthier hence the function of green open space as a recreation area in the downtown. Green Open Space can also function as a spot where people are able to socially interact with each other, function in culture aspect and even function as an area to support the economy of the community around the existence of the green open space. Urban area of Palu city has high temperature because it passed by the equator, sometimes it reaches 36 ℃, even if it is raining during the night but still it is very hot in the daylight. Determination of how green open space starts is from population density and area, it can be seen through several sub-districts because the population of each sub-district is different in terms of number and area. Therefore, it should be regulated from several existing districts. Palu City consists of 8 districts with varying population densities. Method used was quantitative analysis through calculating the need for green open space based on thepopulation in each district. The data were analyzed through the formula and the coefficient per capita. Then it is described in maps of sub-districts in the city of Palu. The results of this research will provide how many public open space is spread in the city of Palu as the capital of Central Sulawesi Province. This can be applied to the map of Palu City. The results of the research will show how many public open spaces are in each sub-district."
A ‘NOVEL’ WAY TO FORECAST FUTURE URBAN FORMS: WELSH CASE STUDIES VIA THE LITERARY METHOD OF URBAN DESIGN,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07360f110438aa25a7f9e8da3f1799c9de871273,Alan Marshall,"This paper explores a novel application of the Literary Method of Urban Design to predict and shape the future forms of three new “case study” towns set in Wales: Swansea, Gilfach Goch and Dinas Mawddwy. This method uses literary works to create “design fictions”. These design fictions aim to provoke debate about potential future opportunities for towns and cities and potential future problems for towns and cities. The three novel case studies explored in this paper are variously inspired by Alan Garner’s novel The Owl Service, Richard Llewellyn’s novel How Green Was My Valley and Dylan Thomas’ poem The Force. Each case study invokes a graphic representation - in the form of scenario art - which visually narrates a future shaped by the themes of the respective works: so transforming the town of Dinas Mawddwy into an urban woodland, reimagining the town Gilfach Goch as a post-industrial paradise and harnessing natural forces to create the living city of Swansea. This approach attempts to consider the vagaries of human characters within unpredictable and dynamic ecologies and social structures but which also integrates cultural and aesthetic dimensions into the art and practice of urban design. The emerging scenarios underscore the potential value of considering artistic methods with qualitative narratives and historical insights to achieve a potentially more holistic understanding of future urban developments - at least in the land of legends and stories that is Wales."

Biomimicry for Regenerative Built Environments: Mapping Design Strategies for Producing Ecosystem Services,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0761e0b3321ec90a454742b786dd12192177f260,M. Pedersen Zari; Katharina Hecht,"Built environment professionals must solve urgent and complex problems related to mitigating and adapting to climate change and biodiversity loss. Cities require redesign and retrofit so they can become complex systems that create rather than diminish ecological and societal health. One way to do this is to strategically design buildings and cities to generate and provide ecosystem services. This is an aspect of biomimicry, where whole ecosystems and their functions are emulated, in order to positively shift the ecological performance of buildings and urban settings. A small number of methodologies and frameworks for ecosystem services design have been proposed, but their use is not wide spread. A key barrier is the lack of translational work between ecology concepts and practical examples of ecosystem services design for a built environment context. In response, this paper presents research underpinning the creation of a qualitative relational diagram in an online interactive format that relates ecosystem services concepts to design strategies, concepts, technologies, and case studies in a format for use by built environment professionals. The paper concludes that buildings and whole cities should be expected to become active contributors to socio-ecological systems because, as the diagram shows, many strategies and technologies to enable this already exist."
Settler Colonial City: Racism and Inequity in Postwar Minneapolis,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0766ee16a94495c2c89e52aec90a3c384cf65b98,M. Ugarte,"within a paradigm. These approaches include degrowth, locally oriented economies, egalitarian economies, nonspeculative economies, triple-bottom-line approaches, and cooperative and finally collaborative economies. Following these seven economic approaches, the authors identify five city-level strategies. Addressing issues at different scales brings together a large collection of information and many good insights. I appreciated that in each chapter, the authors included a table that highlighted the issues and summarized approaches. If the introduction serves as the authors’ agreement with the reader, then these authors fulfilled their stated objectives. Holding these many issues together and providing a basis for normative judgments requires a clear framework. Wheeler and Rosan state that their theoretical framework is “that of social ecology. This perspective analyzes how strategic, interrelated changes on many dimensions—institutions, economics, politics, values, behaviors, technologies, and cognition—can help societies evolve in healthier and more just directions” (p. 7). The authors believe that this framework is useful for complex situations because it allows for multiple viewpoints and incorporates transdisciplinary knowledge. Although the authors effectively explain the shortcomings of the modernity framework, I never firmly grasped how the social ecological framework connected these issues in ways that clarified the complexity. I must acknowledge that my assessment of this book was influenced by having just read Bill Gates’s (2021) book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster. Although Gates focuses only on climate change and reaching net-negative carbon emissions, like Wheeler and Rosan, he also uses questions. Gates’ five questions are: “How much of the 51 billion tons are we talking about?” “What’s your plan for cement?” “How much power are we talking about?” “How much space do you need?” and “How much is this going to cost?” These are the questions that Gates believes we need to ask and answer if we are to avoid the disaster. But after asking these questions, he does his best to provide some answers. A strength of Gates’s book is his ability to provide scale for the global quantities of carbon, electricity, water, land, and other natural resources at play. He explains these unimaginable quantities in ways that clarify rather than obfuscate. His approach helped me to feel empowered, a feeling I rarely have lately. For each problem, I was pleasantly surprised that Gates’s responses extended beyond technical solutions to recognize the role of actors and institutions in the public and private sector. I would describe Gates’s framework as pragmatic problem solving. By sharing his interpretation of the problem and possible solutions, I extracted some useful ideas and guideposts for my own thinking. I admire Gates’s willingness to say what he believes should happen. Therefore, Gates’s approach is markedly different from that of Wheeler and Rosan’s. Gates is ranking the problems and highlighting the most promising solutions to simplify the climate conversation. Wheeler and Rosan are asking many big questions (which include climate change, advancing equity, and improving democracy), collecting strategies appropriate for different scales, and hoping their ideas generate discussions that will motivate action. Neither approach is wrong—just different. I would highly recommend Wheeler and Rosan’s book for those hoping to expand their knowledge of the challenges and approaches needed to “reimagine sustainable cities.” I plan to use a chapter of the book in my Introductory Urban and Environmental Planning class to launch a discussion about effective engagement and activism. However, the book is less helpful for those of us who are deeper into the discussions and seeking the specifics we need to find our way through."
"Territory, sustainability, and beyond: Latin American urbanization through a political ecology",2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0768738f4b8d70c3e1f5d7d00014f1e9426107b0,G. A. Quimbayo Ruiz,"In this article, I identify how territory is a useful concept to explore the political ecologies of urbanization. In the Latin America region, territory is a key concept to explore urban and rural connections between (neo)extractivism, violence, and dispossession, with socio-ecological transformations in the configuration of urban spatialities. Following recent calls to re-locate both urban theory and political ecology beyond the Anglophone debate, the article proposes a dialogue between the Latin American theorization on territory and the political ecology of urbanization. Based on an empirical analysis of urbanization in Bogotá, Colombia, the article also discusses implications for urban justice with respect to territory and sustainability. Finally, the article offers some remarks to further the research agenda on the political ecology of urbanization with a focus on territory."
Establishment and Application of the Assessment System on Ecosystem Health for Restored Urban Rivers in North China,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0775b92c1ffd665cde27b6fa4d290b16ff996f52,Fei Xu; Yonggang Wang; Xu Wang; Dayong Wu; Yuanyuan Wang,"The study on ecosystem health evaluation for restored urban rivers is of specific significance to improving river health and realizing the adaptive management for urban river ecosystems. Based on the health definition of restored urban rivers in North China, this study attempted to set up a system of alternative indicators on ecosystem health assessment, including water quality, water regime, aquatic organism, riparian environment, and physical morphology. Additionally, a set of health assessment system was proposed, including selection of assessment indexes and determination of assessment criteria and health classes. Taking seventeen typical restored urban rivers in Beijing as the assessment target, the said system was applied in assessing urban river health in 2016 and 2019. As the assessment results indicated, in 2016, the health statuses of 29 percent of urban rivers were ordinary, while 71 percent of urban rivers were somewhat inferior. In 2019, the health state of only one urban river reached “good” level. The health statuses of 88 percent of urban rivers were ordinary, and 6 percent were somewhat inferior in terms of comprehensive health index. In 2019, the health states of rivers improved significantly compared with that of 2016, which indicated that most urban rivers saw marked improvement in ecosystem health after ecological restoration. The health assessment system proposed in the paper not only could be applied to regular evaluation of restored urban rivers in the north but also was suitable for a contrastive health-state analysis between different years prior to or after the restoration. In order to carry out adaptive management of water ecology in urban rivers, the measures of ecological restoration could be adjusted based on the regular health assessment and health weakness analysis."
ESCAPING WIND: Form Pensile City on South Bridge Through the Wind,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07bad3fd03f6ea07be49cac51ef9e747f3e2d534,Wu Jiang,"By reorganising the wind to form a pensile city so that more sociological and Technological wind towers can be infiltrated and offered to people to escape is the ultimate goal of my project.Guattari said ""The problem of ecosophy is the problem of the production of human existence itself in a new historical context"". [1] The problem of ecosophy is the problem of the production of human existence itself in a new historical context'. Ecology is inseparable from historical civilisation, and behind every environmental problem there is a human social problem. Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, has been 'notorious' for its environment, despite its growing status and the size of the city. The History of Scotland refers to Edinburgh's Old Town as a ""cramped and fetid district"", and ""the smoke from the numerous charcoal fires and the stench from the countless pieces of rubbish thrown away by people gave Edinburgh the nickname 'Auld Reekie'. This was the most obvious problem of the old city of Edinburgh, and the source of the desire of those who lived in it to escape. 18th century urban expansion gave the rich a chance to escape to the new city, but those who remained continued to live miserably in the old city. Along with the environmental and ecological problems came the social problem of the lack of public space.Although there are many differences between the New Town and the Old Town in terms of planning structure and architectural form, wind is a common element throughout the New Town and the Old Town, but it is also present in different vehicles that travel through the city. For example, in a relatively closed and small space like the Old City, there are few opportunities for people to communicate with each other by sight or face-to-face, but sound, as a carrier of wind, can be a low-cost but efficient medium of communication, allowing people to communicate with others through their own windows, play music, etc. Wind can also leave traces on stones and other materials, for example, in this ancient city made of stone. In the old city, for example, the stones are weathered by the wind and the rain to create a more permeable weathered stone, which gives the plants a good environment to grow, as can be seen in the contrast between the new city and the old. So the wind transmits the past and the present in Edinburgh, connecting different spaces, different classes of people, becoming a common memory for the old and the new city, and still innovating.Therefore, wind is not only a medium, but this thesis will investigate its instrumentation and use it as a methodology for design solutions, exploring the relationship between public space and wind penetration. Pensile city and flight line were developed by Piranesi and Gilles Defeuze. Pensile city refers to the layering of buildings and infrastructure to allow the landscape to permeate the city, flight line offers a way and a route for people to release their desires and seek a more comfortable public space by promoting them, which is also applicable to the city of Edinburgh. The methodology I hope to use to form a pensile city in Edinburgh and thereby infiltrate more public space in response to the desire to escape from urban sprawl, seeks to find a way to regenerate the city of Edinburgh and achieve a sustainable urban development. Finally, the project is being tested at south bridge."

Quarantine measures have forced people to stay inside their homes, leading to the “new normal” of living and adaptation. One activity that has been among Filipinos during the onset of the lockdown until the present time is the increased engagement in gardening. Home gardening suddenly became a widespread activity in rural and urban areas. The use of the words “plantito” [male] and “plantita” [female] denote someone who enjoys taking care of plants. This qualitative study aims to explore and describe the rise of home gardening among Filipinos during the pandemic. A total of 104 participants answered an online survey containing open-ended questions. They described a “plantito/plantita” as a plant lover and nurturer and reported home gardening as a way of connecting with nature, a psychological experience, and an interest. The benefits include stress relief and improved mood. Further studies on home gardening and mental health and possible opportunities to incorporate this activity in communities are warranted."

However, examining compulsory education ecology under the lens of ecology reveals that the entrenched ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"" culture in student learning factors hinders innovative assignment design. The rapid fluctuations in the teacher ecosystem and the weakening of teacher ""ecological resilience"" affect teaching quality. The segregation of the ""home-school-community"" nurturing structure leads to a ""collective absence"" of family and social educational functions. The stable structure of the examination culture leads to a ""two-way squeeze"" between ""intelligence education"" and ""grades."" Ecological damage under the ""middle-class trap"" results in a ""clear reduction but hidden increase"" in students' extracurricular training burden, exacerbating the urban-rural curriculum and teaching ""polarization."" For the ""Double Reduction"" policy to be effective, it should focus on the ""ecological balance perspective"" and the ""ecosystem perspective."" This involves exploring ""smart burden reduction"" methods for student assignments, improving the mechanism for ""double reduction"" work for teachers, establishing a collaborative ""home- school-community"" education internet, returning to the original mission of moral education, enhancing the governance system for selecting and nurturing talent, and achieving ""misplaced"" high-quality development of urban and rural education. This will promote the education ecosystem from imbalance to balance and disorder to systematization, allowing students' learning to return to the essence of education."

However, only in 1975, Mandelbrot gave them the name “fractal” and mathematically defined them as sets whose Hausdorff dimension exceeds the topological dimension. While initially fractals were a pure mathematical phenomenon, afterwards fractal-like properties have been found in many natural and artificial objects and processes. Fractal theory and fractal analysis have been developed and applied in many different areas, including biology, health care, environmental studies, urban planning, geology, geography, chemistry, ecology, astronomy, computer science, social science, music, literature, art, and so on. This paper gives a survey of some of the applications of the fractal theory and analysis to solve different problems in various areas. We give basic definitions and describe frequently used algorithms to compute a fractal dimension. Finally, we apply the fractal analysis to study the geography of Kyiv and Ukraine."
Research on the Evolution and Ptotection of Kulangsu Historic International Settlement Under the Influence of Tourism Development,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0824c7680954ead9335747df87d5440ce5f332e4,Chenxi Zhao,"China has a large number of world cultural heritage sites at present. On the one hand, the rise of tourism can promote the regional economic development. On the other hand, excessive commercialization also challenges the authenticity and integrity of heritage sites. Since Kulangsu has developed tourism since the late 1980s, the cultural ecology of the community has long been overwhelmed by the over-exploitation of tourism. Taking advantage of the opportunity of being registered on list of the world cultural heritage as the “ Historic International Settlement” in 2017, meeting the challenges of tourism commercialization and reviving the traditional community has become important issues for Kulangsu in the“ Post-Applying for the Heritage Era”. This paper, taking the Historic International Settlement of Kulangsu as an example, based on historical literature, through analysis, deduction and induction, first sorts out the historical context and unique values from the aspects of historical development, urban structure, and social economy, and then summarizes the four stages of the community’s evolution being influenced by the tourism development, reveals the alienation crisis faced by the community, constructs the development dynamic mechanism of the community. Finally, integrating the value judgment and development dynamic mechanism of Kulangsu, this paper puts forward the future sustainable development strategy of Kulangsu."

Samples were collected from various urban waste sources in Erbil city, Kurdistan Region, Iraq, including materials such as pizza boxes, cigarette packets, and coffee cups. Pure bacterial colonies were isolated using standard methods, and their morphological and physiological traits were characterized through biochemical tests. Identification of bacterial species followed established protocols. The study identified diverse bacterial species associated with paper waste, highlighting potential hygiene concerns in the recycling process. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the microbial ecology associated with paper waste and recycling processes. By optimizing hygiene measures and gaining insights into the microbial communities present, this research underscores the importance of sustainable practices in paper recycling to mitigate environmental impacts and promote a healthier ecosystem. Policies for future waste management and reduction of environmental risks have been proposed."

A sociology of vegetal life: rethinking ‘harmony’ and ‘nativism’ in Miyawaki forests,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/083eb0ee92952264a2812624a8addb1afb684cd9,C. Adelina,"In this essay, I trace the genealogy of the “Miyawaki forest” or “Tiny Forest” concept by unpacking Akira Miyawaki’s treatises on natural vegetation and situating it within Zürich-Montpellier school of phytosociology. Drawing from impulses in more-than-human geography, I study Miyawaki projects that vouch to create fast, ‘self-sustaining’, close-range forests of native tree species in urban lands. By examining the maxims and techniques adopted in the Germanic study of plant communities, I showcase how such conservation ecologies align with functionalist-organicist traditions of the early 20th century. I pay particularly attention to the ecological concept of ‘potential natural vegetation’ (PNV) based on which species selection is carried out in the Miyawaki forest model. By tracing the notion of PNV – from its origin as an empirical phytosociological construct to providing ecological reinforcements of constructing a pure German vegetation during the Nazi regime – the article explains how right-wing ideologies were fueled by organicism in plant thinking. I showcase how such provincial epistemologies continue to pose reverberations onto the ‘nativist’ ethos of greening programs and urban forests today."
Cybersecurity in Smart Cities: Integrating Advanced Technologies for Urban Infrastructure Protection,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08442ad2cc257d9570d24f1202fbfce7cc5aed75,Sathish Kumar James; P. Deepalakshmi,"Growing urbanisation and technological integration have made smart cities vital worldwide. Modern ICT will boost efficiency, sustainability, and quality of life in these cities. Smart cities are exposed to a wide range of cybersecurity assaults that could threaten their operational integrity and people' well-being due to their growing reliance on digital infrastructure. The many cybersecurity issues in smart cities are examined in this paper. It examines urban information and communication technology (ICT) system vulnerabilities and how cyber events could affect transportation, electricity, and public safety services. We examine smart city cybersecurity and find gaps that make them vulnerable to hackers. We propose integrating cutting-edge technologies with smart city cybersecurity infrastructure to overcome these issues. This framework uses AI and machine learning for threat detection and predictive analytics, blockchain technology for secure data sharing and authentication, and powerful encryption protocols for data protection. We also stress the importance of merging technology and policy to address cybersecurity. Cybersecurity standards, laws, and international cooperation agreements should be created. We believe such an all-encompassing approach is necessary to build resilient smart cities that can withstand changing cyber threats. The report also emphasises the need for ongoing education and awareness initiatives to ensure that all stakeholders, from city authorities to the public, understand cybersecurity and their role in maintaining a safe urban ecology. In conclusion, this research provides a roadmap for smart city cybersecurity by strategically merging cutting-edge technologies and applying the best cybersecurity governance approaches. This document gives policymakers, urban planners, and technology professionals a basic resource to assure the digital future of our urban surroundings."
Bringing Limnology and STEM Careers to Communities in Puerto Rico,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0848c481510005ed669478e85b3807134911eca8,B. Rodríguez‐Cardona; Katherine X. Pérez-Rivera; C. López‐Lloreda,"Under our Global Outreach Initiative project, we conducted a workshop on water quality and stream ecology, and a panel discussion on careers in environmental sciences during July 2022. At the workshop, we had 30 participants from multiple towns across Puerto Rico (Fig. 1A). Participant ages ranged from young children to adults. The workshop consisted of five stations each with a distinct focus and different hands-on activities: (1) stream physicochemical parameters—measure pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and conductivity; (2) nutrients—measure nitrate (NO3) and phosphate (PO4) concentrations; (3) hydrology—experience simulated stream erosion and water infiltration; (4) ecology—identify freshwater shrimp and macroinvertebrates found in Puerto Rico streams; and (5) art—express what was learned through art. For station 1 and station 2, participants analyzed unlabeled water samples from a pristine stream in the rainforest, an urban river, and an estuary. We asked them to identify which one was which based on the results obtained from analyses using water quality kits (pH, DO, conductivity, NO3, PO4), with the goal of applying the concepts learned to familiar ecosystems (Fig. 1B,C). In station 3, participants used a watershed model to simulate different rain events to visualize the effects of stream erosion. In addition, participants created water filtration models using different substrates (e.g., sand, grass, gravel) to test their efficiency (Fig. 1D). In station 4, participants worked with live freshwater shrimp species and preserved macroinvertebrates to learn how to identify them (Fig. 1E). The art project completed at station 5 during the workshop was a great success and reflects the themes that most resonated with the participants, including preserving our water resources and the species of shrimp found in local streams (Fig. 2). All participants enjoyed the activities and were highly engaged during the workshop. We conducted an evaluation postworkshop that demonstrated participants learned a lot, particularly about shrimp and macroinvertebrates and how to measure water quality parameters. In addition, they expressed interest in participating again or in other similar activities."
How does an urban landscape influence spatiotemporal ecology of South American coatis (Nasua nasua)?,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0849295682d14b240af62b15453c8acc3f742336,Wanessa Teixeira Gomes Barreto; G. C. de Macedo; F. M. Santos; Andreza Castro Rucco; N. Y. Sano; William Oliveira de Assis; H. M. Herrera; G. Porfirio; L. Oliveira‐Santos,"Abstract Increasing urbanization and consequent habitat fragmentation and loss call for studies of the influence of urbanization on native fauna. South American Coati (Procyonidae: Nasua nasua) live in groups and are common in urban areas of South America. Here, we aimed to understand how coatis occupy and select space, and whether they change their circadian activity in an urban environment. We estimated home range sizes, verified any overlap, and evaluated the effects of sex and weight on home range size. We also described coati activity patterns associated with habitat selection. Animals established their home ranges only within the study area, with few exploratory exits to surrounding areas. Furthermore, our home range estimates of 0.66 km2 are lower than previously found in natural habitats. We did not observe an effect of sex or weight on home range size. Coatis predominantly selected forested areas and explored houses only early in the morning. We suggest that this demonstrates the need for forested areas for survival of the species. Regarding activity patterns, coatis were active only during the day, as described for the species in its natural environment. Human barriers—in addition to human refuse that serves as food—could reduce the home range sizes. Our data demonstrate differences in home range size, but not circadian activity or habitat selection when compared to coatis in their natural environment. Resumo A crescente urbanização e consequente fragmentação e perda de habitat tornam urgente o estudo sobre a influência da urbanização na fauna nativa. O quati sul-americano (Procyonidae: Nasua nasua) vive em grupos e é uma espécie comum em áreas urbanas da América do Sul. Nesse estudo, buscamos entender como os quatis ocupam e selecionam o espaço e se alteram sua atividade circadiana em um ambiente urbano. Nós estimamos o tamanho da área de vida, verificando a sobreposição entre machos e fêmeas, e avaliamos os efeitos do sexo e do peso sobre o tamanho da área de vida. Também descrevemos o padrão de atividade e a variação na seleção de habitat. Os quatis estabeleceram suas áreas de uso apenas dentro da área de estudo, com poucas saídas exploratórias para as áreas do entorno. Obtivemos estimativas de área de vida de 0,66 km2, inferior ao encontrado anteriormente no ambiente natural. Além disso, não observamos efeito do sexo e peso sobre o tamanho da área de vida. Os quatis selecionaram predominantemente áreas florestais e exploraram as casas apenas no início da manhã, o que sugere a necessidade de áreas florestadas para a sobrevivência da espécie. Em relação ao padrão de atividade, os quatis foram ativos apenas durante o dia, conforme descrito para a espécie em seu ambiente natural. Barreiras humanas, além de dejetos humanos que servem como alimento, podem reduzir o tamanho da área de vida. Nossos dados demonstram diferenças no tamanho da área de vida, mas não na atividade circadiana e na seleção de habitat quando comparados aos quatis no ambiente natural."
Flows in formation: The global-urban networks of climate change adaptation,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0850e6914778b235efe9ec07ef34a6a91fc8157e,Kian Goh,"As climate change threats to urban centres become more alarming, cities are proposing ambitious plans to adapt to climate impacts. These plans are increasingly subsumed within urban development projects, and embedded in global flows of capital and networks of environmental governance and planning. And yet, scholarship on urban adaptation has tended to approach the city as an analytically bounded territory, neglecting interconnections across space and processes of globalisation, urbanisation, and geopolitics. This paper extends theories of relational geographies to explore the emerging conditions of urban adaptation in the context of climate change and globalised urban development. Focusing on the global links of Dutch water expertise, and tracing relationships within and between Rotterdam, New York, and Jakarta, it illustrates the formation of global-urban networks – the multiscalar, multilevel connections through which capital, knowledge, and influence flow. It probes the ways in which these networks emerge to mobilise ideas and influence across geographical scales and political boundaries, driven and defined by interrelated factors including economic relationships, historically defined situational relationships, and interface conditions including narratives of culture and environmental urgency. The paper introduces the concept of ‘network formation’ to see and understand such interconnected, relational processes. It explains the spatial and temporal interconnections within and across sites, and the relationships between urban spatial projects and broader political economies and ecologies. The paper asserts the importance of conceptualising the relationships and interfaces of increasingly mobile and interconnected urban environmental futures."

It highlights Rose's recognition that City Digital Twins are always discursive projections as much as they are actual working simulations, constituted in part by a surrounding ecology of other texts and images that work to transform tech hype into tech reality. The commentary expands on the ‘twin'-nature of all digital images - how their status as both human and machine-readable objects allows them to function as simulations mediating between the realms of the computational and the sensory. The commentary concludes by exploring recent developments in moving image Generative AI. It questions the ‘world modelling' and ‘world simulation’ claims of these technologies."
TRENDS OF ASYMMETRIES AND IMBALANCES IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/085f941f047c8e1a7add2b32e2eff6a283b2fcb0,O. Buluy; M. Plotnikova; O. Prysiazhniuk; J. Ramanauskas,"World experience of rural development proclaims the following directions for regional stimulation: state initiative, unauthorized seizure, development of existing territories, cottage landscaping, etc. The purpose of the study is to identify perspective means for overcoming asymmetries and disparities in the development of territorial communities. The objectives of the study are: 1) Identifying existing asymmetries and disparities in the development of territorial communities; 2) Justifying socioeconomic instruments for achieving the goals of rural development. The research methodology is based on the results of field research conducted by the authors in the rural territories of Ukraine, as well as the experience of rural territories development in the Republic of Lithuania. The study is based on holistic and system-synergetic approaches. National policy's focus on urban development, as a source of budget revenue formation and economic growth, and little attention to rural development have contributed to the emergence of asymmetries and disparities at the regional level. The operation of modern Ukrainian communities is accompanied by problems of rural development, which contributes to the emergence of several structures that contribute to their resolution. The main reasons for people's migration to live in rural areas in Ukraine are retirement age, personal socioeconomic problems, personal beliefs about ecology. The research proves the existence of three basic approaches to defining a community – geographical (understanding the community as a territory), social (community as a set of different relationships), systemic (community as a definition of identity). Activation of communities depends on its leaders, the activities of change agents and the use of modern methods of encouraging their residents to work together and achieve their goals. The community can be involved in ensuring local development through the use of various methods and approaches. In particular, one of the effective methods is creating cooperatives. They have advantages over other forms of organization, first and foremost in a possible grouping of resources needed and flexibility in responding to changes in the environment. The creation of rural communities in Lithuania was initially aimed at solving social problems. Henceforth, they were able to solve economic problems. The results of the comparative evaluation of Lithuanian and Ukrainian rural communities' development are presented. One of the defining directions of ensuring rural socioeconomic development of Ukraine and other countries is forming a new worldview for people. It focuses on ecology, human unity with nature and the enhancement of natural resources potential, as one of the effective mechanisms that can ensure the development of a society. The article will cover the economic and mathematical model of socio-economic processes using the idea «Family homestead»."

Vorob'ev; Oleg Ippolitov,"Objective: show the prospects of using an innovative type of public urban transport - a digital tram on tires with optical guidance along a strip marked on the road or using magnetic markers along the route, as attractive to passengers, cheaper in the arrangement of lines, as well as requiring less time to build than rail tram for urban transportation, allowing to relieve city roads from traffic jams and improve their ecology. Methods: an analysis and generalization of the operating experience of new digital trams built by the Chinese company CRRC, operated in the cities of China: Zhuzhou, Yibin, Yongxiu, Yancheng and Shanghai, as well as the most advanced designs of the operating rolling stock. Results: the operation of the tire tram revealed a number of problems: after a year of operation, severe rutting appeared on a dedicated lane of the road, speeds and capacity were lower than declared. The construction of new tire tram lines required costs for strengthening the roadway, which was not originally intended by the manufacturer. The possibility of their use in winter climate conditions on roads covered with ice and snow has not been proven. Further testing is required to identify and eliminate emerging deficiencies. Practical significance: despite a number of identified shortcomings, it is advisable to use a digital tire tram for cities with a warm climate, with complex terrain and narrow streets as a medium-capacity vehicle that can improve the mobility and quality of life of citizens, as well as reduce the negative impact on the environment. It is advisable to lay it in new residential areas and industrial zones under construction, as well as to use it for mass transportation of passengers in the event of any major one-time events: major exhibitions, forums, Olympic Games, world football championships, etc."

Simulation and Optimization of Urban–Rural Settlement Development from the Perspective of Production–Life–Ecology Space: A Case Study for Aksu City,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08a7c1947b5999205e2a66f869f7f4bedce92180,J. Heng; Hongwei Wang; Yinghui Fan; Zhengwei Wang; Yibo Gao,"To explore the future development state of urban and rural settlements, we combined random forest algorithm (RFA) and cellular automata (CA) to simulate high precision in urban and rural settlements in Aksu city. The settlement distribution was predicted for the next 10 years, and suggestions for urban and rural settlements were proposed based on a “production–life–ecology” space. The results show the following: Transportation factors and administrative location have an important influence on the development of settlements, and infrastructure has a greater impact on the development of settlements. The overall accuracy of the 2019 settlement distribution obtained through the RFA–CA model simulation is 93.8%, with a G-mean coefficient of 0.815. The simulation accuracy is better and more suitable for the simulation and prediction of settlement expansion than the logistic-CA model. The forecasted settlement expansion in 2029 for Aksu city is 58.36 km2 of settlement expansion compared to the 2019 settlement distribution, with an overall growth trend for sparse north-south and dense central areas. This study analyzed the causes of settlement expansion in 19 regions of Aksu city, explored the main function of “production–life–ecology” space in different areas, and proposed layout optimizations from the perspective of production, life, and ecology. The results of this study can provide a reference for the spatial planning and rural revitalization strategy of Aksu city."

Using GPS loggers, we collected detailed telemetry data to understand how fine-scale movements can be analysed in the context of an infectious disease. We recruited individuals living in urban slums in Salvador, Brazil to analyse how they interact with environmental risk factors such as domestic rubbish piles, open sewers, and a local stream. We aimed to identify differences in movement patterns inside the study areas by gender, age, and leptospirosis serological status. Step-selection functions, a spatio-temporal model used in animal movement ecology, estimated selection coefficients to represent the likelihood of movement toward specific environmental factors. With 124 participants wearing GPS devices for 24 to 48 hours, recording locations every 35 seconds during active daytime hours, we segmented movements into morning, midday, afternoon, and evening. Our results suggested women moved closer to the central stream and farther from open sewers compared to men, while serologically positive individuals avoided open sewers. This study introduces a novel method for analysing human telemetry data in infectious disease research, providing critical insights for targeted interventions."

The aim of this work was to contribute to the knowledge of the ecology of A. concepcionensis, through the extension of its known distribution range, recorded in a new type of ecosystem, and the description of the physicochemistry, vegetation and benthic macroinvertebrate and microalgal communities of those sites, which provides information about habitat use of the species. Our results show the presence of A. concepcionensis until 270 km south of the previously described range and reveal that the species inhabits streams and lakes. A. concepcionensis is associated to environments with cold and temperate waters, well oxygenated, with neutral pH and low conductivity, and characterized by low anthropic intervention, which is reflected in the high proportion of native riverine plant species and the high diversity of macroinvertebrate and microalgal benthic communities. We conclude that the previously restricted known distribution range of this species was mainly due to low sampling effort or misidentifications. Our results indicate that anthropic intervention should be avoided or minimized in the distribution area of A. concepcionensis, especially in those areas associated with urban expansion and touristic activities in streams and lakes.

Materials created through this program are rooted in social science insights (e.g., trusted sources, social norms, place-based learning), climate science, and the communication needs of participating regional parks. As a result, the end products (e.g. websites, videos, ranger toolkits) produced by this program fulfill many functions: increasing public awareness of climate impacts on park resources, nurturing the connection between people and places, meeting evolving interpretation demands by developing material for a variety of channels, effectively engaging visitors in climate dialogue, and helping parks lead by example by addressing how a changing climate can alter cultural, natural, historical, and recreational resources. The success, adaptability, and longevity of this program have provided NCR parks with a wealth of innovative products that support the park stewardship mission to preserve resources for future generations. Five examples will demonstrate the breadth of work undertaken by interns."

It increases global temperatures, impacting the health of residents. To date, research on urban heat environments has focused on society or ecology, overlooking the value of integrating the two factors. The research objective is to integrate socio-ecological benefits, explore the construction methods of ecological-cooling networks, and provide reasonable guidance for urban climate planning, thus contributing to the alleviation of urban heat risks and improving thermal comfort. Using Fuzhou as an example, an environmental risk framework was used to construct an urban heat environment risk assessment strategy based on hazards (thermal comfort), exposure (human-development footprint), and vulnerability (natural geographic conditions). The source area was identified based on evaluation results, an ecological network was constructed using circuit theory, and key nodes were identified. Results showed that in 2005 and 2020, 3% and 12% of areas in Fuzhou had higher thermal environmental risks, the proportion of low-risk areas was 43% and 28%, respectively. In sum, 54 ecological source locations, 124 ecological corridors, 76 ecological pinch points, 110 obstacle points, and 12 stepping stones were identified during the construction of corridors in 2020. Compared with 2005, the source area has decreased by 1622.46 km2 and the average length of the corridor has also decreased by 4.69 km."

Harris,"People and wildlife are living in an increasingly urban world, replete with unprecedented human densities, sprawling built environments, and altered landscapes. Such anthropogenic pressures can affect multiple processes within an ecological community, from spatial patterns to interspecific interactions. We tested two competing hypotheses, human shields versus human competitors, to characterize how humans affect the carnivore community using multi-species occupancy models. From 2017-2020, we conducted the first camera survey of city parks in Detroit, Michigan, and collected spatial occurrence data of the local native carnivore community. Our 12,106-trap night survey captured detected data for coyotes (Canis latrans), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), raccoons (Procyon lotor), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis). Overall occupancy varied across species (Ψcoyote=0.40, Ψ raccoon=0.54, Ψred fox =0.19, Ψstriped skunk =0.09). Contrary to expectations, humans did not significantly affect individual occupancy for these urban carnivores. However, co-occurrence between coyote and skunk only increased with human activity. The observed positive spatial association between an apex and subordinate pair supports the human shield hypothesis. Our findings demonstrate how urban carnivores can exploit spatial refugia and coexist with humans in the cityscape."
Assessing Railway Landscape by AHP Process with GIS: A Study of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09797034a2b6060bd6c884a92e6b7d4e93e10d1a,Kun Sang; G. Fontana; S. Piovan,"Landscape quality is a crucial factor for the heritage attractiveness of tourism, allowing tourists to experience both natural and cultural aspects along railway journeys. Moreover, railway landscape is a comprehensive system that defines the landscape observed and perceived by passengers and is characterized by the diversity and continuity of the train’s movement. Yunnan-Vietnam railway (YVR) heritage is the research object of this research, whose area encompasses various landscape types and heritage sites, providing great landscape enjoyment. Currently, the assessment methods specifically for railway landscape have been discussed less than for other landscape types, especially for a series of large linear sites like the YVR. To evaluate the value of railway heritage landscape along the railway, this paper proposes a methodology combining the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Delphi method, and GIS as an integrated spatial assessment. Creatively, this paper seeks to: (1) discuss the relationship between railway and landscape; (2) build a comprehensive evaluation system for the railway heritage landscape, covering the topics of history, tourism, ecology, heritage, social-culture, and visual quality; (3) quantify the landscape value of the YVR areas. Thus, the results of this research can be useful to future urban planning, development, and policymaking."
"And then came this number PM2.5: Atmospheric particulate matter, sociotechnical imaginaries, and the politics of air quality data",2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0980e324674fb301ac07b8095285a0dff787126e,Agáta Marzecová; Hanna Husberg,"This article employs the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries to examine the broader political ecology of particulate air pollution, especially the connections between novel technoscientific practices of making pollution perceptible and data-driven modes of urban governance. Drawing on ethnographic material from Beijing, a city notorious for its pervasive smog, the article highlights the role of air quality data—such as particulate matter measurements (PM2.5) and air quality indexes (AQI)—not only in informing citizens of the health-threatening air pollution but also in influencing new regimes of visibility and shaping practices of urban citizenship. Through the conceptual lens of sociotechnical imaginaries, the article shows that air quality data, increasingly shared digitally in the form of real-time continuous data streams, are not merely technoscientific indexes, nor are they value-neutral. Rather, their conceptualization is informed by technocractic visions of human-air relations and shaped by digital infrastructures. Learning from Beijing, the article argues that in order to generate an expanded understanding of the life-structuring effects of urban air pollution in the era of data-driven urbanism, political ecology of urban air needs to be considerate of how the numbers, which represent pollution, are conceptualized, amassed, and circulated, as well as what and whom they include or exclude."

If cultural approach in urban studies worked largely through cultural turn ideas in the end of 20th century, recently works through reinterpreted and expanded concept of culture as a structure/infractructure of urban life. Reflecting the crisis of cultural turn in urban theory in 21st century some authors and disciplines became more interested in the study of the urban political economies, urban political ecology and critical urban theory. Research seeking to explore recent urban crisis as a result of climate changes, growing social inequality and lack of solidarity in global scale has unsurprisingly been diverse and varied. Analitically this moment is compelling because it emphasizes the weakness of cultural factors in the process of articulation of a new urban ideas. This, however, raises a question with respect to much of the most visible results of urban studies and urban theory: are its proponents inclined to accept again the offer of cultural oriented urban studies in terms of cultural materialism, eco-criticism, eco-philosophy, ethics and aesthetics? Are they ready to rethink the relationship between economic and extraeconomic causality in the conditions of global multilevel crisis? This article is therefore primarily a theoretical attempt to articulate how urban theory might be moulded by global urbanisation in crisis."
"Of Practices and (Micro)politics: Challenges of Organic Waste Segregation in Dschang, Cameroon",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09cd3a0ed1b2c80bf432244e7cab2b689aabfd72,Eric Moye Kongnso; Aristide Yemmafouo; Joël Sagne Moumbe; Rolande Christelle Makamté Kakeu–Tardy; M. Sahakian; René Véron,"Waste generation in Sub-Saharan Africa is increasing rapidly. While biodegradable waste remains predominant, it is rarely treated separately by municipal solid waste management systems, thus foregoing the possibility to reduce the volume going to landfills or dumpsites. This paper discusses the unique case of the small city of Dschang, Cameroon, where the municipality operates two central composting plants that treat about 20% of the city’s household and restaurant waste. Using Urban Political Ecology and Social Practice Theory, this article studies waste flows, waste practices, material arrangements, power relations, social norms, institutional dynamics, and policies to identify opportunities and obstacles for organic waste sorting at the level of households and restaurants. Our analysis draws upon qualitative and quantitative data and points to the importance of the availability of multiple waste bins and monetary compensation for organic waste sorting. These factors have also facilitated the development of an informal waste sector, which might use up to 20% of the city’s waste as animal feed and for home/farm composting. However, complex relations between multiple actors and the national policy framework complicate the emergence of organic waste segregation at source as a common practice. In this way, the study shows that solid waste management is also a matter of power and (micro)politics."
Closely related gull species show contrasting foraging strategies in an urban environment,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09ef1ede8f4885857332e7d752f721701a550981,K. Lato; D. Madigan; R. Veit; L. Thorne,"The expansion of urban landscapes has both negative and positive effects on wildlife. Understanding how different species respond to urbanization is key to assessing how urban landscapes influence regional wildlife behavior and ecosystem structure. Gulls are often described as strong urban adapters, but few studies have explored species-specific differences in habitat use. Here, we use GPS tracking in conjunction with stable isotope analysis (SIA) to quantify the habitat use and trophic ecology of great black-backed gulls ( Larus marinus ) and herring gulls ( L. argentatus ) in an urbanized area. Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) of foraging locations revealed significant differences in the habitat use between species. Great black-backed gulls foraged primarily in marine habitats and herring gulls foraged primarily in specific urban habitats (e.g., landfills, dumpsters) and showed higher site fidelity in terms of the proportion of foraging sites revisited. Further, great black-backed gulls had significantly higher δ 15 N and δ 13 C than herring gulls, reflecting the use of marine, rather than urban, food sources. This study highlights the variability in urban habitat utilization among closely related species, assesses stable isotope signatures of urban diets in wild birds, and discusses ecological implications of the relative contribution of urban and marine foraging."

Competition of Municipal Strategies 2022: History of Strategic Planning and Flagship Projects,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a0c2af359754bb1be94d3450c9838df42cf94a3,B. Zhikharevich; T. Pribyshin,"The article describes the experience of designing and conducting a competition of municipal strategies “Implemented Strategies: From Idea to Execution”, held in 2022. The competition is seen as a method of practice analysis of municipal strategic planning in Russia during 25 years (1997–2022). The materials of participants i.e. 33 municipalities from 19 regions were studied. The participants were divided into three size groups by population. In each group, the winner in the final nomination “The Best Strategic Planning System” was determined based on the results in two intermediate nominations – “The Most Stable Strategic Planning System” and “The Best Flagship Project.” The best in the final nomination were the city of Belogorsk (Amur region), Surgut district and Surgut (both are located in Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug – Yugra). The systems of strategic planning of Koltsovo work settlement (Novosibirsk region), Surgut district and the city of Surgut, starting their history since 2002, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are recognized as the most stable ones. In terms of flagship projects, Zadonsky district (Lipetsk region), Michurinsk (Tambov Region) and Novorossiysk (Krasnodar Krai) are in the lead. Based on the materials of the competition, two approaches to strategies’ updating are identified: frequent change of strategies with a short planning horizon and regular updating of a long-term strategy. The flagship projects were grouped by industry orientation. (Most of the projects are presented in the groups “Production”, “Infrastructure, urban environment, transportation”, “Social sphere, culture, sports”; few projects were in the areas of housing and communal services and ecology.) The criteria for the quality of a set of flagship projects are identified: balance of the set of projects by industry, clear relation with the priorities of the strategy, provision of accelerated development in a certain area, concreteness of the results."
ON PLASTICITY OF THE TERM ECOSYSTEM,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a10e6018ce0f5e446fc337271db01f7ae29870e,A. Altoukhov; Z. N. Afinskaya,"The improvement of the scientific image of the world is closely connected with the development of scientific terminology, with the understanding of its cognitive content. In this process, due to the metaphorical reinterpretation of terms, which is ensured by their semantic plasticity, their reinterpretation or secondary terminologization occurs. Metaphors construct a conceptual system of ordinary and, especially, scientific thinking. The purpose of the study is to highlight the problem of linguistic and cognitive characteristics of terms as a factor in the implementation of interdisciplinary knowledge. The term ecosystem has entered the active circulation of the language of science, where the first element “eco” implies a conceptual connection with ecology. The purpose of the study is to consider the features of the linguocognitive aspect of the term ecosystem. The term ecosystem (écosystème) has a wide range of uses in various scientific fields of knowledge in different national literary languages. Due to its semantic plasticity, it participates in the formation of new term concepts, developing the synergy of scientific thinking. The meaning of a new term does not arise simply as the sum of the values of its term elements, although the meaning of each of them is preserved in it to a certain extent. Thus, the term concept ecosystem has become widespread in various spheres of human activity ((urban ecosystem, marine ecosystem, information ecosystem, entrepreneurship ecosystem, innovation ecosystem, museum ecosystem, narratology ecosystem, media space ecosystem, etc.). Terminology, thus, as a set of definitions of various aspects of scientific knowledge, becomes one of the important sections of cognitive linguistics. A comparative analysis of French and Russian terminology allows us to highlight the problems of not only interdisciplinary connections within one national image of the world, but also to see the peculiarities of the formulation of terms taking into account the specifics of different national languages."
Nest-boxes alter the reproductive ecology of urban cavity-nesters in a species-dependent way,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a131b225a2ecb97268a1a522b795f7927508c42,Joanna Sudyka; Irene Di Lecce; L. Wojas; P. Rowiński; Marta Szulkin,"To mitigate the shortage of natural breeding sites in cities, nest-boxes are provided for cavity-nesters. However, these are not the breeding sites these animals originally evolved in and optimised their breeding performance to. It thus remains inconclusive if nest-boxes can provide adequate substitutes, ensuring equivalent fitness returns for breeding animals. Additionally, the majority of knowledge on the ecology of urban birds comes from nest-box populations, but no study to date directly compared fitness consequences of breeding inside nest-boxes in relation to natural-cavities in an urban context. This limits our understanding of the urban ecology of cavity-nesters and addressing its functional meaning. We investigate fitness consequences and life-history trait variation according to the nesting site type to provide a comprehensive understanding of conservation potential of nest-boxes in cities and to support/question generalisations stemming from nest-box studies on urbanization. We directly compare the reproductive performance of two small passerines, blue tits and great tits, breeding in nest-boxes as opposed to natural-cavities in a seminatural forest of a capital city using a quasi-experimental setting. We show that the effects of nest type vary between species: in blue tits, fitness proxies were negatively affected by nest-boxes (lower fledging success and fledgling numbers, longer time spent in nest and later fledging date in comparison to natural-cavities), while great tit performance appeared to be unaffected by nest type. We detected that both species breeding in nest-boxes accelerated incubation onset, but since there were no major differences in pre-hatching traits (lay date, clutch size, hatching rates) between the nest types, we attribute the fitness deterioration to post-hatching effects. Interestingly, overall breeding density of tits in urban natural-cavities was higher than observed in a primeval habitat. Nest-boxes may become an ecological trap for some species and the unaffected species can consequently outcompete them, decreasing overall biodiversity in cities. We highlight the ecological importance of old-growth tree stands, providing natural tree cavities for city-breeding animals. Due to the detected nest type-dependent variation in reproductive performance, we support the criticism regarding the unconditional extrapolation of evolutionary and ecological interpretations of nest-box studies to general populations."
Unequal and unjust: The political ecology of Bangkok’s increasing urban heat island,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a2056d112e79b5397f75a71a62f074ccc902cdd,D. Marks; J. Connell,"The intensity of Bangkok’s urban heat island during the dry season can be as high as 6–7° and in the densest areas the urban heat island’s intensity is approximately 4°C. The urban heat island thus is causing a city already oppressively hot to become even hotter. The urban heat island also contributes to health problems, such as heat stroke and fatigue, particularly to those with lower incomes. We historically examine the numerous causes of Bangkok’s urban heat island, such as the lack of green space, high levels of air conditioning, and high rates of vehicle exhaust fumes. For example, Bangkok has only three square metres of green space per person which is one of the lowest in all of Asia. Local governmental weaknesses, administrative fragmentation, prioritisation of economic growth and limited buy-in from the private sector have intensified Bangkok’s urban heat island, and imposed numerous barriers to actions that would reduce heat, such as establishing green space, restructuring urban transport or creating and following an effective urban plan. Ideas mooted to remedy these problems have yet to come to fruition, largely because of bureaucratic inertia, fragmentation and divisions within the relevant lead organisations. The political ecology lens also reveals how political–economic processes largely determine the vulnerability of urban inhabitants to heat, but also that thermal governance is highly unequal and unjust. Those who contribute to and profit the most from Bangkok’s urban heat island, such as real estate developers, shopping mall owners, and automobile corporations, suffer the least from its effects, whereas low-income communities hardly contribute to this problem, yet are the most vulnerable."
A multistep approach to improving connectivity and co-use of spatial ecological networks in cities,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a28aad3a7958e58a08326a66260533b867066ae,Simon Beaujean; A.

Corstanje,"Ecological networks are systems of interconnected components that support biodiversity, ecological processes and ecosystem services. Such structures play a crucial role for nature conservation and people well-being in anthropogenic landscapes. Assessing connectivity by using efficient models and metrics is a sine qua non condition to preserve and improve appropriately these ecological networks. This study aims to present a novel methodological approach to assess and model connectivity for species conservation (Bufo calamita; the natterjack toad) and human recreation in the city. The study used a combination least cost and circuit models to identify priority corridors in the City of Liège, Belgium. Green areas, habitats and relevant movement parameters were derived based on existing studies around (i) the occurrence, ecology and biology of the natterjack toad and (ii) human behavioural studies on urban pedestrians. Combining the two models allowed the assessment of connectivity for both species via two different metrics visualised using priority corridors on maps. The connectivity assessments identified lack of connectivity as the potential route to extinction of natterjack toads at one of the source sites. This study provides examples of how combining least cost and circuit models can contribute to the improvement of urban ecological networks and demonstrates the usefulness of such models for nature conservation and urban planning."
Stopover ecology of migrating birds in Indiana,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a30b58023e469d79ebce0fee6389b72668cbae2,J. Outcalt,"Billions of birds migrate annually between breeding and wintering habitats, following
transient resources. Though a majority of time is spent in breeding and wintering habitats, habitats
used during the migratory periods are especially important for migrating birds. Migration and
stopovers, where birds rest and refuel before continuing a migratory journey, are critical points in
a bird’s annual lifecycle, and are important ecologically, socially, and economically. Populations
of migratory birds are declining on a global scale, however, and proper management is vital to
their persistence in an urbanizing environment. Indiana in the Midwestern United States is an
important area in which to study stopover ecology of migratory birds, as it is a fragmented forest-
urban-agricultural matrix almost entirely managed through private ownership. In this dissertation,
I studied three questions of stopover ecology within the landscape context of the Midwestern
United States, primarily using weather surveillance radar and eBird citizen science data.

 First, I studied spatiotemporal changes over an 11-year period (autumn 2005-2016 and
spring 2006-2017) in densities of nocturnally migrating birds at two radar stations in Indiana. I
found that mean density of migratory birds stopping over in Indiana declined by approximately
6.8% annually, but variability in stopover site use increased over the same period. This is consistent
with other work completed on continental scales, and highlights the need for further conservation
of migratory birds. Second, I studied patterns of stopover site use in Indiana during spring 2016-
2017 and autumn 2015-2016, identifying landscape and local factors associated with those patterns.
I used both traditional land cover characteristics and a novel approach using human socioeconomic
measures to describe these patterns, and found that socioeconomics, particularly the size of a
housing unit, were among the most important predictors of migratory bird density in Indiana. The
results from this study suggest that migratory birds are utilizing urban habitats, which are known
to contain several novel hazards for birds, but that migratory birds will benefit greatly from
interdisciplinary work focusing on urban habitats. Third, I explored a novel method of using
weather surveillance radar and eBird citizen science data in combination with each other, to see if
both measures provided similar estimates of bird abundances during stopover. Though I found no
correlation between the two, I argue that eBird and radar still provide important and
complementary insights for the field of migration ecology. Finally, I provide guidelines for private
landowners in Indiana on management for declining populations of migratory birds."

Pollution Characteristics and Sources of Ambient Air Dustfall in Urban Area of Beijing,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a4d5e29d109e356cebe3941f414f2bb92b1a413,Yin Zhou; Beibei Li; Yuhu Huang; Yu Zhao; Hongling Yang; Jianping Qin,"Since 2016, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment and the Beijing Municipal Government have adjusted the minimum concentration limit for ambient air dustfall several times, indicating that they attach great importance to dustfall. To grasp the pollution characteristics and sources of dustfall, in this work, the filtration method was used to determine the insoluble dustfall and water-soluble dustfall in the urban area of Beijing. From our analysis, the influence of the meteorological parameters on dustfall was found, and the chemical components of dustfall were determined. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was also utilized to analyze the sources of dustfall. The results indicated that the average amount of dustfall in 2021–2022 was 4.4 t·(km2·30 d)−1, and the proportion of insoluble dustfall deposition was 82.4%. Dustfall was positively correlated with the average wind speed and temperature and negatively correlated with the relative humidity and rain precipitation. The impact of the meteorological parameters on insoluble dustfall and water-soluble dustfall was the opposite. The average proportions of crustal material, ions, organic matter, element carbon, trace elements, and unknown components were 48%, 16%, 14%, 1.4%, 0.20%, and 20%, respectively. The proportions of the crustal material and ions were the highest in spring (57%) and summer (37%). The contribution rates of fugitive dust source, secondary inorganic source, mobile source, coal combustion source, snow melting agent source, and other sources were 42.4%, 19.3%, 8.3%, 3.0%, 2.7%, and 24.3%, respectively. This study supported dustfall pollution control by analysing the pollutant characteristics and sources of dustfall from the standpoint of total chemical components. In order to better control dustfall pollution, control measures and evaluation standards for fugitive dust pollution should be formulated."

The sound of the future: listening as data and the politics of soundscape assessment,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a726cfde5ddb4f011590026a3e5336ffc79f293,Milena Droumeva,"ABSTRACT This sonic ecology of cities has been highlighted recently by the effects of the global pandemic: fewer cars and people on the road are letting quieter layers of the soundscape to come forward, signalling unequivocally that the urban soundscape is a direct result of anthropocenic activity. This is a time, then, to listen and reflect, and perhaps heed new models for thinking of urban sound. One barrier to such a process is the persistent and entrenched disconnect between soundscape literature, public engagement with sound, and urban planning. By critically surveying literature on soundscape assessment as it intersects with cultural sound studies and acoustic ecology, this paper traces a number of important disciplinary ontologies of everyday listening in cities, ranging from attempts to standardise evaluation metrics and classification of soundscapes, to the emergence of subjective listening studies. More recently a ‘digital commons’ approach to civic engagement has led to crowdsourcing sonic experiences, soundmapping, and, at the infrastructural level – networked monitoring of noise levels. These rhetorical and practical developments fit within important contemporary conversations in critical data and algorithm studies and as such require a critical excavation of underlying values and conceptions of listening."
Benthic-based contributions to climate change mitigation and adaptation,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a8b516469469f1b31a9a4f464efc2c1c30aa069,M. Solan; E. Bennett; P. Mumby; J. Leyland; J. Godbold,"Innovative solutions to improve the condition and resilience of ecosystems are needed to address societal challenges and pave the way towards a climate-resilient future. Nature-based solutions offer the potential to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems while providing multiple other benefits for health, the economy, society and the environment. However, the implementation of nature-based solutions stems from a discourse that is almost exclusively derived from a terrestrial and urban context and assumes that risk reduction is resolved locally. We argue that this position ignores the importance of complex ecological interactions across a range of temporal and spatial scales and misses the substantive contribution from marine ecosystems, which are notably absent from most climate mitigation and adaptation strategies that extend beyond coastal disaster management. Here, we consider the potential of sediment-dwelling fauna and flora to inform and support nature-based solutions, and how the ecology of benthic environments can enhance adaptation plans. We illustrate our thesis with examples of practice that are generating, or have the potential to deliver, transformative change and discuss where further innovation might be applied. Finally, we take a reflective look at the realized and potential capacity of benthic-based solutions to contribute to adaptation plans and offer our perspectives on the suitability and shortcomings of past achievements and the prospective rewards from sensible prioritization of future research.

"The bacterial community composition and its environmental drivers in the rivers around eutrophic Chaohu Lake, China",2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ac7c5e885e40ef0bec28180635a5c6dc5b1ea2d,Keqiang Shao; Xin Yao; Zhaoshi Wu; Xingyu Jiang; Yang Hu; Xiangming Tang; Qiu-jin Xu; G. Gao,"Background Bacterial community play a key role in environmental and ecological processes in river ecosystems. Rivers are used as receiving body for treated and untreated urban wastewaters that brings high loads of sewage and excrement bacteria. However, little is known about the bacterial community structure and functional files in the rivers around the eutrophic Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, has been subjected to severe eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms over the past few decades. Therefore, understanding the taxonomic and functional compositions of bacterial communities in the river will contribute to understanding aquatic microbial ecology. The main aims were to (1) examine the structure of bacterial communities and functional profiles in this system; (2) find the environmental factors of bacterial community variations. Results We studied 88 sites at rivers in the Chaohu Lake basin, and determined bacterial communities using Illumina Miseq sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene, and predicted functional profiles using PICRUSt2. A total of 3,390,497 bacterial 16 S rRNA gene sequences were obtained, representing 17 phyla, and 424 genera; The dominant phyla present in all samples were Bacteroidetes (1.4-82.50 %), followed by Proteobacteria (12.6–97.30 %), Actinobacteria (0.1–17.20 %). Flavobacterium was the most numerous genera, and accounted for 0.12–80.34 % of assigned 16 S reads, followed by Acinetobacter (0.33–49.28 %). Other dominant bacterial genera including Massilia (0.06–25.40 %), Psychrobacter (0-36.23 %), Chryseobacterium (0.01–22.86 %), Brevundimonas (0.01–12.82 %), Pseudomonas (0-59.73 %), Duganella (0.08–23.37 %), Unidentified Micrococcaceae (0-8.49 %). The functional profiles of the bacterial populations indicated an relation with many human diseases, including infectious diseases. Overall results, using the β diversity measures, coupled with heatmap and RDA showed that there were spatial variations in the bacterial community composition at river sites, and Chemical oxygen demand (COD Mn ) and (NH 4 + )were the dominant environmental drivers affecting the bacterial community variance. Conclusions The high proportion of the opportunistic pathogens ( Acinetobacter , Massilia , Brevundimonas ) indicated that the discharge of sewage without adequate treatment into the rivers around Chaohu Lake. We propose that these bacteria could be more effective bioindicators for long-term sewage monitoring in eutrophic lakes."
The Role of Local Authorities in Shaping Local Food Systems,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ad86748c5048fbd3d8bffb1d3c55dbf9bd28614,Tanya Zerbian; Mags Adams; M. Dooris; Ursula Pool,"Given the importance that current food-related challenges pose to our society, the potential of local food initiatives to address sustainability has gained increased attention. Nevertheless, research has increasingly demonstrated that local food initiatives are limited in fulfilling their sustainability potential. This realisation has led many scholars to argue that the path towards food system transformation needs to be based on interconnected networks of these ‘alternative’ practices—what this paper terms local food systems. Nevertheless, as many local food initiatives rely on funding and volunteer work, their capacity to create infrastructures for integrated approaches is limited. In this context, influential players—those who can provide resources, such as local authorities—become key in the assemblage of local food systems. However, there is limited understanding of how the role of local authorities affects the internal dynamics of local food systems and potential outcomes. This study addresses this research gap by analysing two case studies (Preston, England and Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country). Using urban political ecology (UPE) as a theoretical framework, this study offers original insight into the key governance elements affecting the direction of local food systems and thus the alignment of diverse local food initiatives, limiting their sustainability potential."

"Active-Passive Remote Sensing Evaluation of Ecological Environment Quality in Juye Mining Area, China",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ae7cc07ed02fc5841b1640ca95fbdca93452a0b,Yu Chen; Zhihui Suo; Hui Lu; Huibin Cheng; Qian Li,"The coal industry is a crucial component of China’s energy sector. However, the persistent exploitation of coal resources has gravely impacted the ecological environment. While the Remote Sensing Ecology Index (RSEI) is predominantly used for assessing ecological quality, its primary focus has been urban or aquatic environments. There is limited research focused on the evaluation of the ecological environment quality in mining areas. Moreover, the information regarding surface deformation caused by coal mining extraction is an essential factor in the ecological monitoring of mining areas. Therefore, this study proposed the Modified Remote Sensing Ecology Index (MRSEI). This enhanced model merges active and passive remote sensing techniques and incorporates a deformation factor (Surface Deformation Index, SDI) to provide a holistic evaluation of mining area ecologies. Furthermore, for comparative verification, we developed the Eco-environmental Quality Index (EQI) model by selecting 12 ecological parameters and employing a hierarchical analysis. The Juye mining area in Shandong Province was selected as the region of study. MRSEI results from 2015 to 2021 indicate a decline in the ecological quality of the Juye mining area, with MRSEI values registering at 0.691, 0.644, and 0.617. The EQI model mirrors this decreasing trend over the same period. Despite MRSEI using fewer indicators, its assessments align closely with the multi-indicator EQI method. This validates the accuracy of the MRSEI method, providing reliable technical support for the monitoring and evaluation of ecological environment quality in mining areas."

Hybridizing Artifice and Nature: Designing New Soils Through the Eco-Systemic Approach,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0af413d3a1f13c584f9a053f42dfe4c262bf86de,M. Rigillo,"The chapter outlines the cultural background for applying design strategies consistent with the challenge of circularity. The contribution focuses on ecological thinking as an effective design approach to produce and implement eco-innovative strategies able at facing environmental and societal challenges of our global age. Then the chapter depicts the Repair research experience in promoting a systemic design approach for recycling and reusing C&D waste as new, anthropogenic soils in peri-urban areas. According to the EEA Report n.6/2017, the chapter posits that the major environmental challenges of the present are not about single issues, such as waste reduction or soil-loss, rather they involve systemic change and design processes, linking together economy, social habits and technological responses. Therefore, the transition towards more sustainable urban metabolism deeply depends from creative visions by which breaking the circuit “take-make-dispose” and promote new—and somehow tentative—visions for implementing circularity at local and global scale. Further postulation in the paper is about assuming the concept of Anthropocene as theoretical ground for such eco-innovative design approach. The scientific evidence of living in human-dominated ecosystems makes designers towards a paradigm shift concerning the overcoming of the typical artificial/natural dichotomy by exploring the augmented opportunities in designing sustainable and resilient habitats thanks to a more collaborative, plural and innovative design approach: “What is important and significant here is how ecology and landscape architectural design might invent alternative forms of relationships between people, places and cosmos” (Corner, ‘Ecology and Landscape as agents of Creativity’, 1997, reprint in Reed &Lister (2018), Op. Cit., pp. 40–65, p. 42). Starting from these assumptions, the paper deepens the experience of collaborative design for implementing recycle and reuse of C&D waste for producing new technical soils, according to both the regulatory constraints (and potentials) and the site-specific features. The research goal is to provide new vegetated soils by waste thanks to an innovative design process based on both circular economy principles and collaborative knowledge production. Notably, the capacity of producing creative hybridization between biotic and abiotic component seems to be the new frontier in the field of technological design and material engineering. The term hypernatural, proposed by Blaine Brownell and Marc Swackhamer in 2015, introduces the idea of a co-evolutionary process between nature and science, looking at humans’ technological capacity as an effective opportunity for creating the conditions for making biotic ad abiotic systems working together: “The ultimate aim of technology is not antinatural: it is hypernatural” (Brownell & Swackhamer in Hyper-natural. Architecture’s new relationship with nature. Princeton Architectural Press, New York, p. 18, 2015). The chapter deals with the methodology applied for promoting a sort of protocological architecture (Burke, 2007), by which facilitating the C&D waste recycle and reuse within the construction sector, and notably into the landscape project. The research starts working under the H2020-Repair project, and it has developed within further research programs about C&D waste management in urban regeneration programs developed by the Department of Architecture of University of Naples Federico II."
Gut microbiome variation in juvenile blue tits in a European urban mosaic,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0afde5be445ece25169be30ebf2e77e0d02e1c94,Lena Fus; Sebastian Jünemann; Irene Di Lecce; Joanna Sudyka; Marta Szulkin; Öncü Maraci,"Urbanisation transforms natural environments, impacting not only wild animals living in cities but also the microorganisms they are hosting. To better understand urban-driven variation in microbiological composition and diversity in the gut of birds developing in urban areas, we collected faecal samples from blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus nestlings using nestboxes distributed across the capital city of Warsaw, Poland. Sampling included a variety of urban habitats, a suburban village and a natural forest area. Microbiome analysis unveiled a pattern of reduced alpha and beta diversity in urbanised settings driven by impervious surfaces. Additionally, we observed that this effect was year-dependent, therefore highlighting the importance of temporal replication in ecological research. Furthermore, comparing two cavity types (natural and human-made), we demonstrated that artificial nestboxes, a tool widely used in field ecology, can impact the microbiome assembly in nestlings. Our results align with and expand upon earlier insights in great tit Parus major gut microbiome variation inferred in the same urban study system on a species ecologically related to the blue tit, confirming the pervasive impact of urbanisation on the avian gut microbiome."
Cyanobacterial Blooms in City Parks: A Case Study Using Zebrafish Embryos for Toxicity Characterization,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b008f0c5902fed2b89bd93c4ed81b08e5e423ed,Bruna Vieira; João Amaral; Mário Jorge Pereira; Inês Domingues,"Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes that play an important role in the ecology of aquatic ecosystems. However, they can also produce toxins with negative effects on aquatic organisms, wildlife, livestock, domestic animals, and humans. With the increasing global temperatures, urban parks, renowned for their multifaceted contributions to society, have been largely affected by blooms of toxic cyanobacteria. In this work, the toxicity of two different stages of development of a cyanobacterial bloom from a city park was assessed, evaluating mortality, hatching, development, locomotion (total distance, slow and rapid movements, and path angles) and biochemical parameters (oxidative stress, neurological damage, and tissue damage indicators) in zebrafish embryos/larvae (Danio rerio). Results showed significant effects for the samples with more time of evolution at the developmental level (early hatching for low concentrations (144.90 mg/L), delayed hatching for high concentrations (significant values above 325.90 mg/L), and delayed development at all concentrations), behavioral level (hypoactivity), and biochemical level (cholinesterase (ChE)) activity reduction and interference with the oxidative stress system for both stages of evolution). This work highlights the toxic potential of cyanobacterial blooms in urban environments. In a climate change context where a higher frequency of cyanobacterial proliferation is expected, this topic should be properly addressed by competent entities to avoid deleterious effects on the biodiversity of urban parks and poisoning events of wildlife, pets and people."
Long-Term Water Quality Monitoring: Using Satellite Images for Temporal and Spatial Monitoring of Thermal Pollution in Water Resources,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b05737d680f8e74f50b72b73975fb90833a69f9,Reza Naimaee; Abbas Kiani; Sina Jarahizadeh; Seyed Babak Haji Seyed Asadollah; P. Melgarejo; Antonio Jodar-Abellan,"Thermal pollution reduces water quality through any process that leads to a change in the water’s ambient temperature. Karun is one of the most relevant sources of water supply in Iran, and its pollution, created by industrial, urban, and agricultural issues, has been one of the most critical challenges throughout the last few years. As the water temperature rises, the amount of dissolved oxygen in it decreases, thereby affecting the entire ecosystem associated with it. Drainage of urban and industrial runoff into surface water sources can increase the water temperature. Dams also constitute a significant part, modifying spatial patterns of temperature along river routes and causing thermal contamination. In this paper, the thermal pollution of the Karun River was assessed, and regions along this river with unusually raised water temperatures were identified and compared over 20 years. By analyzing the results, it can be found that the thermal pollution from dams has a significant impact on the downstream river environment and ecology that is considerably relevant during summer periods, showing average decreases of 3 degrees Celsius immediately beyond the dams’ locations (from 41 degrees Celsius upstream dams to 38 degrees Celsius beyond them) or even bigger (reductions of 13 degrees Celsius in one of the studied dams). Hence, our results showed that water temperature is colder downstream in the hot seasons of the year than upstream of the dams. The results suggest that the usage of remote sensing data effectively could complement collected data from ground-based sensors to estimate water temperature and to identify pollution areas. It provides experts with spatially extensive and highly synchronized data."

Improving attitudes and knowledge in a citizen science project about urban bat ecology,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b1149b3c018ce3c6e8a66698bc412273d8cb9c8,H. Greving; Till Bruckermann; A. Schumann; T. Straka; Daniel Lewanzik; S. Voigt-Heucke; Lara Marggraf; Julia Lorenz; Miriam Brandt; C. Voigt; U. Harms; J. Kimmerle,". In order to deal with the current, dramatic decline in biodiversity, the public at large needs to be aware of and participate in biodiversity research activities. One way to do this is citizen science projects, in which researchers collaborate with volunteering citizens in scientific research. However, it remains unclear whether engaging in such projects has an impact on the learning outcomes of volunteers. Previous research has so far presented mixed results on the improvement of citizens’ attitudes and knowledge, mostly because such research has focused only on single aspects of citizen science projects in case studies. To address these limitations, we investigated the impact of an urban bat ecology project on citizens’ attitudes and knowledge about bats, and on their engagement with citizen science. We also examined whether the degree of citizen participation (i.e., collecting data vs. collecting and analyzing data) had an influence on the outcomes. We conducted four field studies and used a survey-based, experimental, pre-/post-measurement design. To vary the degree of participation, we assessed the post measurement in one group directly after data collection, whereas, in a second group, we assessed it after data collection and analysis, at the end of the project. Across all studies, the results demonstrated that citizens’ content knowledge of urban bat ecology increased, and their attitudes toward bats and toward their engagement in citizen science improved during their participation. Citizens’ degrees of participation did not influence these outcomes. Thus, our research illustrates that citizen science can increase awareness of urban bat conservation, independently of citizens’ degree of participation. We discuss the implications of our findings for the citizen science community."
Designing Function-Specific Plant Systems for Sustainable Urban Development,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b28526f9246e23a80fdb65b80d1ccc8d446fa21,K. French,"Increasingly, architects are embracing “biomorphic urbanism,” a design ideology that takes inspiration from nature to develop more sustainable cities that reduce the environmental impact of urban life. At the moment, plants are incorporated into biomorphic urban designs for conservation or aesthetic reasons. Here, I argue the role of plants in building more sustainable cities can be augmented by integrating plant sciences, ecology, and urban design. I propose that we can develop synthetic Function-Specific Plant Systems (FSPSs) which harness the genetic and metabolic diversity of plants to perform specific services that benefit society and the environment as a whole. FSPSs can contribute to three broad categories of urban life: Urban Landscape and Infrastructure; Biodiversity and the Environment; and Human Health. Across the three categories, FSPSs can be designed to provide nine key services: flood control, soil stabilization, fire control, climate control, water treatment, habitat for endangered flora and fauna, pest control, air purification, and modulation of human immune systems. The plants included in each FSPS are based on several considerations, including (1) functional traits, (2) biogeography, and (3) cultural concerns. In the future, synthetic biology could improve, expand and diversify these services. This approach harnesses plant biodiversity to transform urban spaces while meeting key UN Sustainable Development Goals."

Here, we develop a first method to quantify and map urban diversity. Our article begins with a concrete example through which we demonstrate how to apply a basic version of our method to create a diversity map for a given urban area. This map is easy to interpret and can be used to accurately locate the most diverse centers of urban activity. We then go on to show how our basic method can be expanded to quantify many different types of urban diversity, and how it can be used to create regional and global diversity maps. Such diversity maps are relevant in both studying diversity and modeling the dynamics of diversification in urban environments. We conclude the article by making a bridge to other scientific disciplines, and by proposing six key steps that may serve as a foundation for a general framework for the evaluation and mapping of diversity across all fields of science."

Political ecologies of a university and land at Cairo's urban periphery: The American University in Cairo's suburban desert campus,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0be5bf5313148fa7777dc373c1b0d9d8410df32c,Danya Al-Saleh; Mohammed Rafi Arefin,"In 2008, the American University in Cairo (AUC) moved from its downtown campus in Tahrir Square to the center of New Cairo. Through an analysis of AUC's historical land acquisitions at Cairo's urban periphery, this article examines how the university sought to influence land use over the past century. We argue that AUC's relatively recent role in New Cairo is an expression of the institution's century-long aspirations to acquire land on Cairo's periphery for a permanent suburban style campus. Drawing on the tools of political ecology and critical university studies, we trace how a suburban desert campus is consistently envisioned as a mechanism for the institution to play a significant role in influencing land politics and use in and beyond its campus. We highlight two key ways that AUC has historically situated itself in the city's development. First, purchasing land in order to relocate to the outskirts of the city has been central to AUC's strategy for accumulating wealth to ensure its long-term presence in Egypt. Second, acquiring large tracts of land for a suburban desert campus has been instrumental to AUC's educational mission to shape its student body, Egyptian society, and the political ecology of desert land in Egypt. Through archival research, we show how AUC's relationship to land positions the university as a significant institutional force in Cairo's rapidly urbanizing desert periphery. This situated case study contributes to an emerging body of scholarship examining the fraught historical and contemporary relationship between universities, land, environmental knowledge, and uneven urbanization in the Middle East and beyond."

 This article examines the history of Haitian-owned freighters that have been trading between Haiti and the Miami River since the 1970s, how this shipping economy became racialized in ways that marked it and the river with a “threatening” Haitian Blackness, and how local government agencies, real estate developers, and law enforcement officials worked to remake the aesthetics of the river as something other than Haitian and Black. Projects to re-racialize the riverway played with the spurious surface-and-subsurface spatial logic of racial discourses more generally—that is, the mistaken but widely-held belief that visible, physical markers of race reveal hidden capacities and propensities. Policing that pushed Haitian commerce into an economy of containerization—a race- and class-marked shipping technology on the river—allowed the Haiti trade to “pass” as non-Haitian on a gentrifying waterway. Law enforcement programs that seized and sank Haitian freighters to create artificial reefs off the Florida coast bluewashed the river’s surface and its ethnoracially coded, “polluting” vessels by transforming them into subsurface, “White” recreational ecologies. These processes reveal how politically fraught contests over racialization recruit layered material environments as part of larger projects of policing, re-racialization, and urban renewal. In exploring this history, the article pushes against arguments from some quarters for a “post-critical” turn by demonstrating that reflexive critique, with its focus on the hidden and the submerged, remains necessary for grasping the ways racialization processes operate through structures of material and discursive layering."
Anthropogenic Effects on the Contemporary Sediment Budget of the Lower Rhine‐Meuse Delta Channel Network,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0bfef5b8ac8b1ce4ff22112261c45aa035d30bd2,J. Cox; Y. Huismans; S. M. Knaake; J. Leuven; N. Vellinga; M. Vegt; A. Hoitink; M. Kleinhans,"Deltas and estuaries worldwide face the challenge of capturing sufficient sediment to keep up with relative sea‐level rise. Knowledge about sediment pathways and fluxes is crucial to combat adverse effects on channel morphology, for example, erosion which enhances bank collapse and increasing tidal penetration. Here, we construct sediment budgets which quantify annual changes for the urbanized Rhine‐Meuse Delta of the Netherlands, a typical urban delta experiences changing fluvial and coastal fluxes of sediment, engineering works and dredging and dumping activities. The delta shows a negative sediment budget (more outgoing than incoming sediment) since the 1980s, due to anthropogenic intervention. Following a large offshore port expansion, dredging in ports and harbors in the region has doubled in the past 5 years, likely due to the induced change in net sediment fluxes. In addition, the deeper navigation channels, ports, and harbors are now trapping siltier sediment, changing the sediment composition in the mouth. The removal of sediment by dredging is adverse to the necessity for sediment in heavily eroding branches. To allow for sustainable sediment management in the future and to cope with sea‐level rise, further measurements are required to properly quantify the amount of incoming sediment at the boundaries of the system and the internal mechanisms of transport. The varied response of the branches has important consequences for navigation, ecology and flood safety and management of the sediment in the system. These effects will be of pivotal importance in coming decades with similar implications for many urbanized deltas worldwide."

As a member of the family Flaviviridae and genus orthoflavivirus, CPCV’s intricate ecological association with vectors and hosts raises profound questions. CPCV’s transmission cycle may involve birds, rodents, equids, bovines, marsupials, non-human primates, and bats as potential vertebrate hosts, whereas Culex and Aedes spp. mosquitoes have been implicated as potential vectors of transmission. The virus’ isolation across diverse biomes, including urban settings, suggests its adaptability, as well as presents challenges for its accurate diagnosis, and thus its impact on veterinary and human health. With no specific treatment or vaccine, its prevention hinges on traditional arbovirus control measures. Here, we provide an overview of its ecology, transmission cycles, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and prevention, aiming at improving our ability to better understand this neglected arbovirus."

Networks, circulations, and mobilities have shaped our vision and understanding of this waterway. This article charts a different kind of story, one that explores the Straits not as a space of passage but rather as a place of production. It shows how and why these waters became an industrial fishing zone — an industrial estuary, as it were — in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Through the case of Bagan Si Api Api, a Hokkien-built town at the mouth of Sumatra's Rokan River, it explains why estuaries and migrants were central to Southeast Asia's urban rise from 1870 to 1940. By looking at the Straits during this pivotal moment, the article reveals the ways in which ecologies, beliefs, technologies, and cultures all combined to shape not only the economic life of Southeast Asia's estuaries, but also, and more importantly, the place of these estuaries in the region's economic life."

Humans have so thoroughly transformed the region that it is hard to imagine that it was ever full of wild plants and animals. And since much of the English-language scholarship on the Zhou period focuses on the texts and ideas of urban elites, it is easy to forget that most people were rural farmers living in environments full of wild plants and animals, and that many places had no humans at all. Scholars in various fields have produced abundant new information on the environments of ancient China, making it possible to reconstruct climate and ecology far more accurately than was possible before. This research shows that, contra older claims that ancient North China had a subtropical climate, the climate of the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods was only slightly warmer and wetter than the present. The most important factor in the transformation of the region's ecosystems has been humans, not climate. We will focus on the pre-imperial period because various lines of evidence suggest that the first millennium b.c.e. was a period of population growth in which agricultural societies wiped out many of the natural ecosystems of lowland North China. Only by reconstructing what North China looked like thousands of years ago will we be able to understand how humans came to be the dominant force in the region's ecology."
"A Comprehensive Evaluation of Water-Saving Society Construction in Xinxiang, Henan Province, China",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c4c648b1d4f996441c2162e165d0db657540250,Mingliang Jiang; Chengcai Zhang,"Water is a crucial and fundamental resource. It is well known that agricultural cultivation, industrial production, and human daily life are not possible without water. Efficiently utilizing water resources is of great significance for achieving global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In order to improve water use efficiency in various industries and promote water-saving development, China has been implementing water-saving society construction since 2002. Henan Province is the main grain-producing area in China, with wheat production accounting for a quarter of the country’s total. As the core area of “Central Plains Agricultural Valley” in Henan Province, Xinxiang City plays an important role in agricultural technology innovation and agricultural production. However, Xinxiang City is facing problems of water scarcity and pollution, which constrain the sustainability of agricultural production. Therefore, building a water-saving society can solve the current water problems faced by Xinxiang City and ensure the sustainable development of the economy and society. This study built an evaluation index system for water-saving society construction in Xinxiang, Henan Province, China. The proposed evaluation index system includes 20 evaluation indices from six aspects—integrated, agricultural water, industrial water, domestic water, water ecology and environment, and water-saving management—and then divides its development level into several stages. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was adopted to calculate the index weight. Then, a comprehensive evaluation model for water-saving society construction in Xinxiang City was established by combining it with grey relative analysis (GRA). The results showed that the overall level of water-saving society construction in Xinxiang City is in the excellent stage, whereas water consumption per CNY 10,000 of GDP, the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water, the reuse rate of industrial water, and the leakage rate of urban water supply network are all in the good stage. However, the urban recycled water utilization rate is still in the poor stage. These research results can effectively and reasonably reflect the development level of water-saving society construction in Xinxiang City and guide the continued implementation of water-saving society construction. At the same time, the comprehensive evaluation of water-saving society construction helps to formulate and adjust water resource management policies and measures; it also holds significant value for sustainable water management and combating water scarcity."

The Importance of Individual and Expert Knowledge Grows as Clan Identity Diminishes: The Bedouin of Southern Israel Adapt to Anthropocene Ecology,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c5598af64e22d2f42f2790d18c3021808258c4e,Michael Weinstock; Turky Abu Aleon; Patricia M. Greenfield,"Before the Anthropocene, Bedouin communities in Southern Israel were based on a clan structure—a kin-based social network; clans were culturally and socially homogenous communities with a strong authority structure. Work consisted of subsistence activities necessary for physical survival. Group-based authority and cooperative problem solving were adaptive in this ecology. Throughout the Anthropocene, the Bedouin of Southern Israel have had to adapt to diverse urban environments, expanded educational opportunity, and exposure to media emanating from different cultures. Our study explored the implications of these ecological shifts for epistemic thinking by comparing three generations of 60 Bedouin families: adolescent girls, their mothers, and their grandmothers (N = 180). Families were evenly divided among three residence types differing in degree of urbanization and degree of population homogeneity: unrecognized Bedouin villages consisting of single clans; recognized Bedouin villages, towns, or cities, consisting of multiple clans; and ethnically diverse cities. Results: Across the generations, media exposure and formally educated parents have weakened the epistemic authority of family elders, in turn weakening clan identity. Ethnically diverse cities have weakened extended family identity. At the same time, personal knowledge and professional expertise have gained new cultural importance. These changes in epistemology and identity are adaptive in the ecological environments that have multiplied in the Anthropocene era. Local identity was strongest both in diverse cities, with their many attractions, and in unrecognized villages, where the population continues to occupy ancestral lands."

Recognising rivers' capacity for agency, the idea is developed in relation to contemporary Aboriginal Australian poetry narrating long-standing human interdependencies with rivers. The hydropoetic verse of Jack Davis, Samuel Wagan Watson, and Jeanine Leane reveals embodied relations to—and relational epistemologies of—rivers and their habitats through a focus on Derbal Yerrigan (the Swan River) of Western Australia, Marrambidya Bila (the Murrumbidgee River) of New South Wales, and Maiwar (the Brisbane River) of Queensland, respectively. Their writing integrates Dreaming narratives and elicits river poiesis, while also confronting aquatic conservation urgencies in Australia. Evoking sacred rivers whose origins lie in the Dreaming, their work also presents a medium for reverent listening to the fluvial world. While Leane’s hydropoetics centres on the mediating role of memory—hers and the river’s—Watson’s poetry calls attention to fractured river ecologies in Brisbane's urban environment. For Davis, bodily relationality between humans, plants, and rivers presents a potent means of ecopolitical resistance through multispecies solidarity. Immersed in Aboriginal creation narratives, an Indigenous hydropoetics foregrounds the multidimensional intersections between humans, rivers, and all life, thus energising new imaginings of rivers and encouraging receptivity to their biocultural complexities."
Ecosystem Services and Urban Planning,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c5cc13571e705d7ffc26918f6cbe87fb41fd7b4,Savun Sangha,"Purpose: The main objective of the study was to explore ecosystem services and urban planning. 
Methodology: The study adopted a desktop research methodology. Desk research refers to secondary data or that which can be collected without fieldwork. Desk research is basically involved in collecting data from existing resources hence it is often considered a low cost technique as compared to field research, as the main cost is involved in executive’s time, telephone charges and directories. Thus, the study relied on already published studies, reports and statistics. This secondary data was easily accessed through the online journals and library. 
Findings: The findings revealed that there exists a contextual and methodological gap relating to ecosystem services and urban planning. Preliminary empirical review emphasized the need for sustainable urban planning practices that integrate ecological considerations, prioritize green infrastructure and biodiversity conservation, and address disparities in access to ecosystem services. Urban planners and policymakers are key actors in ensuring the well-being of urban populations and the environment, making informed decisions about land use, transportation, and sustainability practices crucial. These findings have implications for environmental advocacy groups and policymakers, as they underscore the importance of advocating for eco-friendly urban development to protect and enhance critical ecosystem services, ultimately creating more resilient and equitable cities that benefit both people and the environment. 
Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The Urban Political Ecology Theory (UPE), Ecological Modernization Theory and Resilience theory may be used to anchor future studies on ecosystem services. The study provided recommendations to enhance urban planning practices. It suggests integrating ecosystem services into planning processes, emphasizing the importance of green infrastructure and biodiversity conservation within cities, and promoting community engagement and collaboration among stakeholders. These recommendations aim to create more resilient and sustainable urban environments that prioritize the well-being of residents while safeguarding and enhancing the valuable ecosystem services urban areas provide."

From square to park: In search of centrality for Les Glòries in Barcelona,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c6dd365c2b19c8ffa8776f7d4724b610babb567,Cristina Ros Ballester,"Abstract The project to transform the Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes in Barcelona from a space dedicated to motorized traffic into a large urban park with the role of a central public space for Barcelona is integrated into a citywide network of linear parks and its design is based on the principles of urban ecology. Since its creation in the Ensanche Plan, all the proposals for Les Glòries were aimed at transforming this site into the centre of Barcelona. Although Les Glòries has been a disruptive urban element for most of its history, every time urban planners have sought to redefine its function it has been conceived as a unifying urban element. The different debates on the successive transformations of the site may provide insights into the thoughts, expectations and uncertainties in the minds of the urban planners as to how they believed the city centre should be developed."

"Staged ecologies: Aesthetics, nature and infrastructure in the late‐modern metropolis",2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c789763b68fc5862ff22c06ed8d72ecd5f58f39,Zuhri James,"This paper critically examines a £1.5 billion regeneration project that is currently unfolding in Thamesmead, a town in south‐east London. Led by the housing association Peabody, the ongoing regeneration is attempting to transform the town into a new ecological refugium in the heart of London. One key focus underlying the regeneration revolves around the curation of a ‘wilder Thamesmead’, which is looking to incorporate new wild ecologies into the design of the urban landscape. Principally, this is manifesting in a network of rain gardens which are being transformed into new ecological infrastructures tasked with adapting and responding to the intensifying pressures of the climate crisis. These emergent gardens, however, are also being designed to perform an aesthetic mode of labour that Peabody refer to as ‘greening the grey’: an approach that is embracing a new, dishevelled ecological aesthetic across Thamesmead's historically grey and concrete urban landscape. These rain gardens are therefore merging the infrastructural with the aesthetic, straddling two key areas that the field of urban political ecology is yet to sustain engagement with: namely, expanded conceptions of agency as these relate to an ongoing ‘ecologisation’ of modern urban infrastructures, and the aesthetics of these emerging eco‐modernist infrastructures as they are staged across the urban realm. The paper works through the tensions and contradictions underlying this attempt to curate an aesthetically wild and infrastructurally responsive urban landscape, focusing on how the horizons of a liberal‐capitalist order are being refashioned under a new, duplicitous environmentalist guise. The paper concludes by arguing that the confluence between urban nature and landscape design needs to be further interrogated from a critically modified and ultimately interdisciplinary neo‐Marxian lens."
Optimization and Construction of Ecological Security Patterns Based on Natural and Cultivated Land Disturbance,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c95cfc1b2e590ed7f180c5592df42578e7bcd81,Tianyue Ma; Jing Li; Shuang Bai; Fangzhe Chang; Zhai Jiang; Xingguang Yan; Jiahao Shao,"In previous research on the construction of ecological security patterns (ESPs), the positioning characteristics of urban development were rarely considered, resulting in the identification of key conservation areas that are insufficient to support the ecological security of the entire region and the overall development of urban functions. Firstly, a “quality-importance-connectivity-balance” framework was created to identify ESPs and chose Liaocheng City (LC), a typical main agricultural production area, as the study site. Secondly, the ecological security level of the watershed perspective is an integrated resistance assessment method that exhibits topography, human activities, distance, and agricultural environmental impacts. Finally, the coordination pattern between agriculture and ecology was divided by the comprehensive quality of cultivated land and ESPs. A “six cores-seven belts-three zones” optimization pattern was constructed based on the components of ESPs and the distribution of cultivated land comprehensive quality. The study presents a novel approach for measuring ESPs and is an essential resource for ecological conservation and regional development planning in agroecologically complex regions."
THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES OF THE URBAN PLANNING FORMATION,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c997327d58609957c718b930730d93ebf0d9445,K. Chechelnytska,"The article examines the key works that formed the scientific foundations of modern urbanism. They reflect the peculiarities of the stages of the formation of this science and form a general idea of its fundamental components. The history of the development of scientific research summarizes the process of formation and clearly demonstrates the main periods of the formation of urbanism. A retrospective review of scientific works made it possible to identify key moments in the development of urbanism, starting from the first theoretical studies and ending with modern urban planning practice. Over several centuries, urbanism has evolved from intuitive planning methods to a complex scientific discipline that covers a wide range of issues: from architecture and engineering to sociology, ecology and economics. The research methodology is built on a historical approach. The following methods were used: terminological analysis, comparison, systematization, forecasting. Thanks to the systematization of the ideas of thematic works of urbanists of different periods, which constitute the theoretical basis of modern urbanism, it can be concluded that the works can be divided into classical theoretical and practical applied. Regarding the prospects for the evolution of urbanism in the context of globalization and sustainable development of cities, it is necessary to note the sphere of innovative technologies, which allows opening up new horizons for the study and analysis of urban spaces. Also, thanks to the research conducted, it is possible to trace the trends in the complication of the object of urban knowledge, which are influenced by internal aspects, namely social, environmental, economic, psychological, etc. Modern urban research is aimed at finding the optimal combination of innovative technologies and sustainable development in order to ensure the harmonious existence of cities and their residents in the face of global challenges.

Pesanggrahan River, located at Southern Region of Jakarta, Indonesia which has a meander channel at the border between the middle reach and downstream reach. The river was normalized at the end of the year 2012 with several modifications such as resection, realignment and cutting-off meandering bends. Analysis the effect of normalization consisting of meander cut-off and riverbank stabilization presented in this paper in term of the behaviour of sediment transport along the channel that has been normalized.

The Ackers-White equation used to calculate the amount of sediment for each section based on the change of the river section due to sediment motion after normalizing of the channel river. From the results of the study, it is proposed that a river naturalization or low impact development (LID) approach, such as floodplain management especially at the meander bend with riparian ecosystems that maintain stabilization at the riverbank also maintain habitat heterogeneity, is an important factor for the long-term survival of several rare and endangered species."
Growing Ecologies: Growing Communities,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0caca2f143d4889fdb1499b17b89e98fb79ddffd,Matthew Potteiger,"First paragraphs: 
The contemporary community gardening and urban agriculture movements have transformed the fundamental notion of the city, challenging the urban/rural dichotomy and applying an agronomic model to remake urban spaces as productive systems. Recently, another model has emerged, that of the food forest, which is based on the form and function of forest ecosystems for producing food. Much like the early innova-tive efforts of urban agriculture, community supported agriculture operations (CSAs), and other alternative food system projects, the emergence of food forests across the country has been a grassroots effort informed by a few key references and with little coordination across individual efforts. 
The Community Food Forest Handbook: How to Plan, Organize, and Nurture Edible Gathering Places provides a very timely and thorough overview of this new type of productive landscape. Of the 30 food forest projects that form the basis of the book, only one has been in existence for more than 10 years. The authors, Catherine Bukowski, a Ph.D. candidate at Virginia Tech, and John Munsell, professor in the College of Natural Resources and the Environment at Virginia Tech, each with extensive experience in agroforestry, summarize the lessons learned from a systematic analysis of these examples to develop a guide for groups involved with or intending to develop their own community food forest. This handbook effectively documents the state-of-the-art of this emerging practice. . . ."
Zooscape ecology: a conceptual analysis of zoos and landscape ecology,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0cc11f83e418c7636126aa511ffa7c7d326ae516,Daniel Bisgrove,"Zoos are a unique landscape with fascinating connections to the principles of landscape ecology. These ‘zooscapes’ have a focus on managing wild species. This article examines the multiple scales of zoos as urban green spaces, exhibit landscapes, and resources for resilience. I identify that landscape ecology can inform zoo evolution and note how zoos may provide a novel research site for landscape ecology. I provide a brief history of American zoos and insight into lingering questions within zoos, including their representations of animals and humans. Additionally, I note conceptual overlap between zoo design/function and landscape ecology literature. Zoos provide habitat for native species and valued cultural ecosystem services. Zoo exhibits developed a landscape focus as modern landscape ecology emerged in the 1980s. Patches, corridors, and matrices exist within a zoo, and these facilities have value for the genetic support of fragmented populations. Zoos’ strategies for disease management are increasingly relevant for global health. Simultaneously, zoos must exhibit sustainable landscapes, not just ecological simulacrums for threatened species. Zoos must promote humanity’s continued coexistence with other species. A landscape view is essential to achieving this goal. Zoos need to model sustainable landscapes of our present and future."

Hauggaard-Nielsen; Stefan Gaarsmand Jacobsen,"ABSTRACT Finding ourselves in the midst of a plural eco-social crisis, this paper addresses roles and guiding questions for action research understanding, envisioning, practicing, and organising eco-social action, with the aim of renewing our human entanglements with the living ecologies, in which we are embedded. Driven by the aim of democratising eco-social transformations, climate- and biodiversity disasters are approached as symptoms of a plural eco-social crisis. From an eco-feminist position, this crisis concerns notions of mastery and extractivism eroding human and societal capabilities to sustain the inherent regenerative capacities of the living. Grounded in critical utopian action research, the paper addresses four different dimensions in action research for eco-social transformation: i) enabling social learning spaces to make visible the ways we are socially and ecologically related; ii) re-imagining how we want to live and relate in wider ecologies; iii) seeking alternatives to mastery through tangible practices; and iv) enabling new organisational forms for societal reorganisation. Building on concrete cases from urban planning to rural and regenerative practice, this paper describes how these different perspectives can mutually strengthen action research for eco-social transformation."
Urban political ecologies of the apple: practices of corporate-led and community-led trade in the London city region,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0cde1580af065d093745fd4cf7f60129e7b9cb63,P. Nicol,"ABSTRACT This article investigates the urban political ecologies of the apple in London city region. As one of the largest cities in Europe, London is a pertinent site to explore the challenges and possibilities of future food systems. The apple is used as a lens to explore the diverging urban political ecologies of corporate-led and community-led food systems. A mixed method qualitative research approach combines a series of semi-structured interviews with stakeholders involved in producing, distributing and trading apples with practice-based ethnographic fieldwork, responding to calls within urban political ecology for more situated and grounded approaches that build new understandings of socio-environmental practices. Research shows diverging practices and biophysical properties of the apple amongst producers supplying multiple retailers and those operating via a community-led trading mechanism, which includes a farmers’ market and fruit and veg box scheme. Fieldwork suggests apple production for multiple retailers is retail-led, placing increasing pressures upon producers. Biophysical properties of the corporate-led apple are becoming increasingly standardised; narrow in terms of varietal range, and; privatised, via the rise of club brand apples. In contrast, fieldwork suggests community-led trade is based upon producer-led, agroecological approaches to production, distribution and trade. Biophysical properties of the community-led apple are context-dependent and diverse in terms of varietal range, quality and size. Community-led trading is identified as a mechanism for scaling agroecology through cultivating community social and ecological relations and producer-led approaches. To become more than marginal, agroecology and community-led trade require enabling policy, planning and legislative frameworks."
Visually Communicating Artificial Urban Wetlands,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d020781cf18d15e0fb1be6963f92d18b38280ba,Alexandra Lara Crosby; Ilaria Vanni; Sarah Jane Jones; Holly O’Neil,"Introduction
Urban wetlands in Australia are under threat, yet they provide benefits for climate change mitigation, pollution reduction, habitat provision, and socioecological connection. In what is now known as Sydney’s inner south and inner west, wetlands were significant places maintained by Aboriginal peoples for millennia (Foster). The violent colonial history that shaped Sydney unfolded along its extensive and dynamic wetlands and connecting waterways. Water was enclosed, drained, dammed, and channelled underground to service the city’s growth. “Unproductive swamps” were filled in for factories and housing.
Today, in an era of unprecedented urban growth, wetlands are making a comeback, with urban renewal projects incorporating artificial systems into water-sensitive urban design with shallow, densely planted ponds that help filter water through physical and biological processes. Artificial wetlands in densely populated areas are increasingly recognised for their effectiveness in reducing the runoff volume and the level of pollutants before stormwater enters urban creeks, rivers and oceans. They are “a key technology in the design of water-sensitive urban centres” (Fitzgerald 171).
Although some Sydney wetlands are revered and protected without question, such as the Ramsar-listed Towra Point Nature Reserve, others are undervalued as urban ecologies. Green infrastructure such as wildlife corridors, verges, rain gardens, pocket parks, and artificial wetlands are not well understood as being both on Country and connected to infrastructure (pipes and drains), ecosystems (critters, plants, and groundwater) and leisure activities (pets, sports, walking, running, and being together). It has been pointed out that focussing on wetlands only as habitat for waterbirds or iconic species “creates an exclusionary environmental protection practice that can have adverse consequences for an ecosystem intrinsically connected to its surroundings, as wetlands are” (McDonald and Gillespie 3).
In this article, we examine an artificial wetland at Sydney Park, adjacent to the Green Square urban renewal site. Through a visualisation method we call “photo diagramming” (Jones et al.), we ask the question: how might visual communication play a role in helping to make artificial wetlands more legible as socioecological systems?
First, we offer a brief history of Sydney Park, also describing how the artificial wetlands were designed. Then, we introduce our photo diagram, which shows how artificial wetlands operate as contact zones between the human-centred and more-than-human needs of cities, generating the edges necessary for recombinant ecologies to thrive (Crosby et al.). Finally, we explore what we can learn from a visual appreciation of artificial wetlands in urban Countries that might translate to other artificial yet beneficial aspects of urban environments.
Artificial Wetlands
Constructed wetlands and artificial wetlands are used interchangeably, although “constructed” seems to be preferred in engineering literature and “artificial” is often used in public communications, such as informative signage. The interchangeability of these words regarding wetlands is significant to our argument about what wetlands can teach us about urban nature. Wetlands in the city are both artificial and constructed, challenging conventional ideas of nature in urban contexts. The ecologies they generate are recombinant in the sense that they emerge through human intervention.  
Australian artist Tega Brain engineered an artificial wetland system to demonstrate this point. Coin Operated Wetland cycles water in a closed loop system and washed dirty clothes. Through the system, Brain visually explains how water, although often made invisible by the urban life it sustains, is constantly circulating in “natural” ways, even if the systems that support the circulation are engineered by humans, and arguably artificial.  
Queer ecologies, which first emerged as a distinct framework in the mid-1990s (Seymour), can also contribute to enhancing distinctions between the artificial and the natural. Geographer Taylor Coyne describes the hybrid spaces of Sydney’s swamps (wetlands) as queer watery ecologies: “low-lying areas typified by soggy sports fields, pond-dotted golf courses, parks intersected by stormwater canals, and remnant wetlands, swamps, marshes, and creeks. … Partially dry but not always fully wet – sit at the interface of the surface/sub-surface ecologies of the region” (Coyne).
In this article, we focus on a particular artificial wetland in a typical Sydney swamp, at Sydney Park, in Gadigal, Dharawal Country, to show how human-made infrastructure can be thought of as natural, how urban ecological systems are all in fact constructed, and how Country underpins it all.
Locating Sydney Park in Colonial History

We walk to one boundary of the park, looking for a drain we have seen on historic maps, the Munni channel. From previous research on water stories of the area (Vanni, Ilaria and Crosby), we know this channel meets Shea’s Creek, which then runs into the Cooks River, and that this connection is crucial to the design of the park’s wetland system. A fenced-off area is clearly signed to keep us out, but a small concrete overpass, heavily decorated with graffiti, provides a viewing platform. There are workers in high-vis vests and knee-high gum boots. Their movement makes waves; clearing, hosing and flushing the water in the opposite direction to the flow of the channel.
We ask, “Is this the Munni channel? Where does this water go?”
They are friendly, but it is clear they are unsure, shrugging and shaking heads. “There was a sewage overflow,” they reply. “It's not meant to happen, but sometimes it does. We are just here to fix that problem.”

Sydney Park is a 44-hectare park located on sand dunes and wetlands Country between Kamay (Botany Bay) and War’ran (Sydney Cove). The Sydney Park Stormwater Harvest Scheme upgraded the park over two years and was completed in 2015. It is now an iconic, award-winning piece of green infrastructure (“Sydney Park Wetlands”). Dogs enjoy extensive off-leash areas; runners ascend the rolling hills; and children play in large playgrounds and learn to ride bicycles on gentle cycle tracks. A skate park, sports oval, outdoor fitness areas, and a city farm – all designed around a series of ponds.
To understand the ecological and social significance of Sydney’s wetlands, we have to think back to how this Country was cared for before invasion, before the dredging and channelling that provided the hard surfaces the city was built on. Forest of turpentine and ironbark trees with swamps, marshes, and heath where Aboriginal people “hunted kangaroo on the grasslands here and fished and camped at the swamps, creeks and rivers that crisscrossed the area.” (Sydney Park: Kangaroo Ground to Brickpits | The Dictionary of Sydney).
The watery pre-colonial landscape generated rich alluvial soil in the area. Some pockets were terraformed for gardens and orchards, and many areas became a significant source of clay in the 19th and 20th centuries. Brickworks remained operating until 1970. Like many brickworks sites in Sydney, the pits at Sydney Park were also used as a local tip (Dictionary of Sydney). Some of the decommissioned Bedford Bricks kilns are retained in the landscape of the park, a trend in public space as “the chief form of memorialising the disappearing industrial history of Sydney” (Murray).
A Working Landscape in the Picturesque Style
In this section, we briefly describe how the wetlands intersect with urban renewal, building on colonial aesthetics. The artificial wetlands at Sydney Park were made between April 2013 and October 2015 (“Sydney Park Wetlands”) and now function to manage the existing flood problems in the Munni Street catchment and ensure that “new development is compatible with the flood hazard and does not create additional flooding problems in other areas” (Cardno). In other words, to prepare for urban renewal.
In keeping with the urban renewal desire to create green, natural spaces in the city, the park updates principles of the picturesque in landscape design. This trend, developed in Europe in the eighteenth century, plays with ideas of artificially naturalistic landscapes, designed to mimic nature, and carefully planned to guide the appreciation of wildness (Brook). Design elements update the eighteenth-century picturesque into contemporary Sydney abound in the park. Viewing stations that shaped the viewer’s experience by suggesting a precise point of view (Brook 171) become wetlands lookouts that invite park users to stop, contemplate, and read the explanation signs on wetlands critters. Variety, contrast, and irregularity are translated in the undulating terrain and planting of native species in different heights, textures, colours, and flowering patterns which create habitat for diverse water birds. The winding paths, sudden views, and contrasts between light and shadow of picturesque landscapes materialise in walkways through the wetlands that open into vistas framed by trees.
The Munni Street Stormwater System (Sydney Water System number 74) is the built infrastructure within the Munni Street Catchment, one of the three sub-catchments of the Cooks River Catchment. Nearly all of the Munni Street Catchment lies within the City of Sydney area. The catchment includes the suburbs of Newtown, Alexandria, Camperdown, and Erskineville and is roughly bounded by Sydney Park to its south. As mentioned in the vignette above, the Munni Street catchment discharges into Alexandra Canal through the concrete channel near Burrows Road.
Most importantly to flood management, the Sydney Park wetlands divert stormwater through underground pipes. When the water levels are high, water is drawn from the channel into the Sydney Park Wetlands.  
According to City of Sydney, the wetlands also filter water through a pollutant trap "

As a civilized ancient city with long history, Tianjin have attracted and integrated many cultures and customs into a unique “Tianjin style” culture. This paper systematically analyzed the regional and cultural ecology development of Tianjin, based on historical evolution. Such development is unique for its cultural exchange and invasion by foreign cultures. The study on the continuation mechanism of Tianjin's urban public space landscape provides a better understanding of the evolution patterns of urban public space landscape. In Tianjin, foreign cultures competed and collided with Chinese traditional cultures and eventually formed a blended cultural style of Tianjin. “Tianjin style” public space absorbed both Chinese and Western cultures and integrated features of both Northern and Southern China. Therefore, it is unique for its combination of diversified cultures."
Effectiveness of Seed Traps for Assessing Seed Rain in Periurban Grasslands,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d36614ecb0dc8c2a36106e67729a6a4093ca0e1,Clément Gros; A. Bulot; F. Braud; S. Aviron; Hervé Daniel,"Landscape context plays an important role in plant community structuring, with selection pressure affecting dispersal ability. This is particularly true in cities, where land use heterogeneity and habitat fragmentation can affect plant dispersal patterns. Seed rain surveys are often used to study dispersal but involve a wide variety of methods and trap types and rarely address the urban context. This study aimed to (1) compare seed rain, especially of anemochorous seeds, in different spatial contexts in a periurban area in Angers (western France); and (2) compare seed rain captured using different trap types (funnel traps/sticky traps), trap heights, and shapes. Seven sites, each equipped with five replicates of funnel traps, were selected in a periurban area in the western part of Angers. Within one of these sites, ten types of traps (differing in trapping method, height, shape, degree of tilt, and area) were employed and their performance compared. The results show that trap height rather than trap type is responsible for differences in seed density and composition. Furthermore, the composition of collected seeds appears to be associated with surrounding land cover, in particular built areas, which has implications for urban ecology in terms of understanding the influence of landscape factors on plant dispersal."
Pathways for the Amplification of Agroecology in African Sustainable Urban Agriculture,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d51973bf75dd579546438d33be49803bf132734,C. Peano; S. Massaglia; C. Ghisalberti; F. Sottile,"A growing awareness that highly intensified agricultural systems have made a substantial worldwide contribution to the worsening of the resilience capacity of natural ecosystems has, over the last twenty years, brought general attention to agroecological management models. This aspect is even more evident in industrial agriculture, which is based on the use of multiple chemical products derived from non-natural synthesis. In more developed countries, a new idea of ecology linked to agricultural production has been increasingly developed and, for this reason, there has been a greater diffusion of differentiated agricultural models taking into consideration the environmental impact of production choices and policies addressed to the conservation of natural resources. In urban agricultural production, it is even more important to adopt resilient production models that, in addition to developing responsible production paths and allowing a positive connection with the needs of consumers, guarantees reasonable and positive behaviors respecting the environment in which most of the urban population lives; in other words, the implementation of goal 12 of the sustainable development goals (SDG #12 Responsible Production and Consumption) of the United Nations. In this work, we report some case studies inspired by the activities carried out by the Slow Food Association in Africa and demonstrate the importance of agroecological models in small-scale agricultural systems, related to the development of school and community gardens in small urban areas of different African countries, as a tool for integrating agricultural activities aimed at social resilience and the conservation of ecosystems."
"Strategic Approach, Advances, and Challenges in the Development and Application of the SIT for Area-Wide Control of Aedes albopictus Mosquitoes in Reunion Island",2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d5a7cebaaed7607cdfc9c76a4c3fc6557183cc8,L. Gouagna; D. Damiens; C. Oliva; S. Boyer; G. Le Goff; C. Brengues; J. Dehecq; J. Raude; F. Simard; D. Fontenille,"Simple Summary Aedes albopictus is a well-established competent arbovirus vector in Reunion Island, a French overseas territory in the Indian Ocean, occurring in a range of natural to urban environments where it represents a major threat to public health. Following the 2006 Chikungunya outbreak and periodic occurrence of dengue epidemics, the sterile insect technique (SIT) emerged as the most environment-friendly option for integration with the current vector control strategy that relies mainly on the elimination of breeding sites and insecticide applications. This paper describes the trajectory that has been followed in assessing the feasibility of SIT against Ae. albopictus in Reunion Island, and reviews some of the main achievements since 2009. These include essential scientific information so far obtained on the biology and ecology of Ae. albopictus, and the development of the requisite technological capabilities for the production and release of sexually competitive sterile males. Furthermore, it also draws attention to the strategies established to streamline the decision-making process, including an awareness campaign to enhance public understanding, efforts to secure public acceptance and regulatory validation of SIT pilot testing for small-scale suppression of wild Ae. albopictus in selected urban sites on the island. Abstract The global expansion of Aedes albopictus, together with the absence of specific treatment and vaccines for most of the arboviruses it transmits, has stimulated the development of more sustainable and ecologically acceptable methods for control of disease transmission through the suppression of natural vector populations. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is rapidly evolving as an additional tool for mosquito control, offering an efficient and more environment-friendly alternative to the use of insecticides. Following the devastating chikungunya outbreak, which affected 38% of the population on Reunion Island (a French overseas territory in the southwest of the Indian Ocean), there has been strong interest and political will to develop effective alternatives to the existing vector control strategies. Over the past 10 years, the French Research and Development Institute (IRD) has established an SIT feasibility program against Ae. albopictus on Reunion Island in collaboration with national and international partners. This program aimed to determine whether the SIT based on the release of radiation-sterilized males is scientifically and technically feasible, and socially acceptable as part of a control strategy targeting the local Ae. albopictus population. This paper provides a review of a multi-year and a particularly broad scoping process of establishing the scientific and technological feasibility of the SIT against Ae. albopictus on Reunion Island. It also draws attention to some prerequisites of the decision-making process, through awareness campaigns to enhance public understanding and support, social adoption, and regulatory validation of the SIT pilot tests."
NEO-KAJANG: SEBUAH TIPOLOGI BARU PEMUKIMAN EKOLOGIS BAGI KOMUNITAS SUKU LAUT,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d6b0103c5a2d0fcfbf947734b62c15d5e80870b,Octaviany Octaviany; Alvin Hadiwono,"The development of the city today is not all in a positive direction. urban growth that is too fast and unplanned, it can cause changes to lifestyle, knowledge, locality, identity, etc. The Sea Nomad is a community that is known to live on a canoe called a kajang. However, since the 1990s, the Sea Nomad has been placed in a marginal position and also does not know civilization and modernity, so it is categorized as an isolated Nomad. Therefore, the Sea Nomad became a target in the government's agenda, namely by limiting their access to the sea and building settlements for them. This forces the Sea Nomad to live a different lifestyle from the one they used to live, bringing themselves to a new awareness of ""awareness as a landed Sea Nomad"" and causing the emergence of new values, changes in spatial behavior (livehood, social organization, etc.). ). This project uses a hybrid method with parameters, namely the Symbiosis Philosophy of Sea Nomad and Beyond Ecology which are applied in the design. “Neo-Kajang” means “Beyond-Kajang”, Kajang is the term for where the Sea Nomad live, while “New typology of marine tribal ecological settlements” means adapting the journey and way of life of the Sea Nomad into a new typology to answer the challenges of the times. This project is also expected to be able to elevate the way of life of the Sea Nomad in the face of changing times where in fact the Sea Nomad is a real example of the philosophy of living efficiently and at peace with the environment, especially the maritime area.Keywords: beyond ecology; modernity; new typology; sea tribes.Abstrak Perkembangan kota sekarang ini tidak segalanya mengarah kearah positif. Karena pertumbuhan kota yang terlalu cepat dan tidak terencana dapat menimbulkan perubahan terhadap pola hidup, pengetahuan, lokalitas, identitas, dll. Suku Laut merupakan masyarakat yang dikenal biasa hidup di atas sampan yang dinamakan kajang. Namun sejak tahun 1990-an, Suku Laut ditempatkan pada posisi yang marjinal dan juga tidak mengenal peradaban dan modernitas, sehingga dikategorikan sebagai suku terasing. Oleh sebab itu, Suku Laut menjadi sasaran dalam agenda pemerintah, yaitu dengan membatasi akses mereka terhadap laut dan membuatkan pemukiman untuk mereka. Hal itu memaksa Suku Laut untuk menjalani pola hidup yang berbeda dengan yang dulu biasa mereka jalani, membawa diri mereka kepada kesadaran baru “kesadaran sebagai Suku Laut yang mendarat” dan menyebabkan munculnya nilai-nilai baru, perubahan spatial behavior (livehood, organisasi sosial, dll). Proyek ini menggunakan metode hibrida dengan parameternya, yaitu Filosofi Simbiosis Suku Laut dan Beyond Ecology yang diterapkan didalam perancangan. “Neo-Kajang” artinya “Melampaui-Kajang”, Kajang merupakan istilah dari tempat tinggal Suku Laut, Sedangkan “Tipologi Baru Pemukiman Ekologis Suku Laut”, berarti mengadaptasi perjalanan dan cara hidup Suku Laut ke dalam tipologi yang baru untuk menjawab tantangan zaman. Proyek ini juga diharapkan mampu mengangkat cara hidup Suku Laut dalam menghadapi perubahan zaman dimana sejatinya. Suku Laut merupakan salah satu contoh nyata tentang filosofi hidup effisien dan berdamai dengan lingkungan, khususnya wilayah kemaritiman.  "
Aspects of the Ecology of Urban-Nesting Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in South-Coastal British Columbia,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d7f88494ebe900b0e586d04b86e9961438b6c46,Raphaël Goulet; D. Bird; D. Hancock,"Abstract. Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) populations throughout North America have increased considerably since the ban of DDT in 1972 and eagles now inhabit suburban areas in large numbers. To better understand the ecology of urban populations living in south-coastal British Columbia, we compared nest-site characteristics, reproductive rates, and diets of more than 150 breeding pairs of rural-, suburban- and urban-nesting eagles in the Greater Vancouver area. Three-quarters of the nests were located within 230 m of buildings and roads, or within 31 m of a potential source of disturbance. Urban eagles nested in live, taller trees that were close to the edges of patches, whereas rural eagles used shorter trees and occasionally human-made structures such as transmission towers. Eagles at nests located close to patch edges and in areas with greater human land use had higher reproductive rates than those at isolated nests or in remote rural habitat. Waterfowl and gulls (family Laridae) were common in the diet across the study area, but urban eagles also used alternative sources such as C-O sole (Pleuronichthys coenosus), Bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), and Band-tailed Pigeon (Patagioenas fasciata). Eagles in the Vancouver area have adapted to human-altered landscapes; management strategies should focus on maintaining edge habitat, monitoring population expansion in urban areas, and protecting nest sites."
Moving past the challenges and misconceptions in urban adaptation research,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d80ed022411b63ebf938e6b903f8d2479f8ab15,K. Winchell; K. J.

Verrelli,"Abstract Although the field of urban evolutionary ecology has recently expanded, much progress has been made in identifying adaptations that arise as a result of selective pressures within these unique environments. However, as studies within urban environments have rapidly increased, researchers have recognized that there are challenges and opportunities in characterizing urban adaptation. Some of these challenges are a consequence of increased direct and indirect human influence, which compounds long‐recognized issues with research on adaptive evolution more generally. In this perspective, we discuss several common research challenges to urban adaptation related to (1) methodological approaches, (2) trait–environment relationships and the natural history of organisms, (3) agents and targets of selection, and (4) habitat heterogeneity. Ignoring these challenges may lead to misconceptions and further impede our ability to draw conclusions regarding evolutionary and ecological processes in urban environments. Our goal is to first shed light on the conceptual challenges of conducting urban adaptation research to help avoid the propagation of these misconceptions. We further summarize potential strategies to move forward productively to construct a more comprehensive picture of urban adaptation, and discuss how urban environments also offer unique opportunities and applications for adaptation research."
The Indoor People’s Enchanted Ecologies,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d91dfe173078d40ca6f2b4b6c265eaacf1985dd,Cecilie Rubow,"
 Contrary to the taken-for-granted dictum in nature politics and in public media that “loving nature prompts care,” this article considers less intuitive relations between love and ethics. Through the analysis of different enactments of natures in Denmark and a reading of Jane Bennett’s Enchantment of Modern Life, the article captures how sensibilities and moralities swing from anethical moments to affective forms of responsibility. By comparing walks at a recreational beach with activists’ campaigns at a peri-urban commons and a climate activist march in the capital center, Cecilie Rubow proposes, inspired by Bennett, to think of a variation of chords of wonder and ethics. Dissonantly, the chords of the enchanted ecologies range from magical moments in remote nature to love and respect for co-living plants and animals, and to the perplexing and motivational awareness of one’s entwinement with the whole planet. This reconceptualization of enchantment speaks to the depth of the ecological crises."
The Humanistic-Anthropocosmic Paradigm as a Framework for Transforming Slum Settlements in Indonesia,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d94af0cc00261ba3d09976945b316f295d05247,Y. D. Purbadi; R. Lake,"The aim of this paper is to elucidate the new humanistic-anthropocosmic paradigm as a framework for transforming urban slum settlements in Indonesia amidst climate change and within a multidimensional living context. The paper elaborates on the ideas of Father Mangunwijaya and draws inspiration from the encyclical Laudato Si. The methodology employed involves a literature review and reflection on the paradigm of transforming slum settlements that have been implemented in several cities in Indonesia. Findings suggest that the Humanistic-Anthropocosmic paradigm, a fusion of Father Mangunwijaya's ideas and inspiration from the encyclical Laudato Si, holds the potential to facilitate sustainable and environmentally friendly transformation of urban slum settlements, considering social, economic, and environmental aspects. This article contributes to the development of a paradigm for transforming urban slum settlements rooted in humanistic architecture, education for liberation, ecological spirituality, integral ecology, and anthropocosmism."
COMPARING URBAN HEAT ISLANDS IN ERBIL CITY-IRAQ: INVESTIGATING VEGETATION RESPONSE THROUGH DAY AND NIGHT THERMAL INFRARED DATA AND NDVI VALUES,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d9b4b86f2e15e51914023d0aa372bd987eee77c,H. Abdullah; S.H. HAMA SHAREF; D. K. Omar; M. A. Çullu,". Land surface temperature (LST) is crucial in understanding urban environments, climate dynamics, hydrology, ecology, and agriculture. While daytime thermal infrared (TIR) data from satellites have been extensively used to analyze LST and the urban heat island effect in arid regions, exploration of nighttime LST data over semi-arid urban areas using high-resolution TIR data is lacking. This study aims to investigate spatial and temporal Land Surface Temperature (LST) variations in Erbil City, located in the Northern part of Iraq, utilizing high-resolution Landsat-8 data for daytime analysis and ECOSTRESS data for nighttime evaluation. The research reveals distinct daytime Urban Cooling Intensity (UCI) and significant nighttime Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects, with UCI primarily driven by early morning Landsat imagery. Notably, a prominent UHI effect occurs at night, particularly in May and June. Daytime LST values show no significant differences among land cover categories, while nighttime LST decreases in areas with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) > 0.5. The study emphasizes the importance of high-resolution nighttime TIR data in investigating UHI in arid and semi-arid regions, addressing a gap in prior research that overlooked this aspect. The prevailing hot and arid climate weakens vegetation’s thermal buffering capacity during warmer months, resulting in the absence of distinct temperature variations in the study area."

Sharova; S. Hohmann,"This paper reports the results of field studies carried out in November 2018 in the towns of Murmansk Oblast and in February — March 2020 in the city of Murmansk. The research was aimed to evaluate resilience of the Kola North as the most extensively urbanized northern region and of Murmansk as the largest city above the Arc-tic Circle. The material for the paper is based on the poll data of 444 residents of Murmansk Oblast and interviews of 23 residents of Murmansk. A residence-stratified sampling model combined with sex and age quotas has been employed. On the basis of research on resilience in psychology and theory of time-space of Mikhail Bakhtin, the authors conduct analysis of the perception of the population towards the elements of urban chronotopos: time (chronos), space (topos), and human (anthropos), which either repel the population, thus weakening the resilience, or attract it, hence strengthening the resilience. The level of resilience of a region is firmly bound to the population attitude towards it, and apathy towards the city, let alone hatred, take a heavy toll on the resilience of the cities in the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation, instilling conditions for weakening bods between people and the dwelling and causing decay of the social climate. In this paper, we identify problematic urban areas induc-ing negative emotions of the population (climate, ecology, standard of living, state of the education and infrastructure, a lack of ideas and perspectives of development which are clear to the urban residents) and strong points enhancing the resilience (natural environment, social links, pace of living, frontier location, understanding of his-torical role and strategic importance). Models of mental behavior which have effect on the urban resilience have been identified. It is argued that temporary and shift workers have negative effect on the urban resilience, whereas positive influence comes from traditional and new nomads, innovators, proprietors and amateur researchers. Traditional nomads of the Kola North — fishermen and seamen — create the image and mission of the cities understandable to their residents. The model of a new nomad brings dynamics and hospitability to the region. The innovator creates new models of development of the territory, while the proprietor explores the North and looks after it. The model of special importance for the cities of the Kola North is that of exploration, characteristic of researchers and artists, since new values may become new ideas of the cities supporting their resilience."
"Urban Parks Quality Assessment Using Multi-Dimension Indicators in Chengdu, China",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ddd24c3bf61443dae9985d49b05747cbd342e01,Sining Zhang; Haoxiang Song; Xiaopeng Li; S. Luo,"High-quality urban parks are considered an integral part of health resources as they can deliver diverse ecosystem services. However, the quality of parks is not always similar, resulting in different levels and values of the services provided. A systematic and complete assessment frame of urban park quality is limited. From the perspective of landscape architecture and design, this study aims to propose a comprehensive assessment framework of urban park quality based on six dimensions (planning and design, cultural services, complete and various facilities, landscape planting, landscape management, and landscape ecology), consisting of 27 indicators with different weights by using the objective and subjective weighting method. Taking the city of Chengdu, China as a case study, 100 urban parks are studied via field investigation and scored using methods that consist of a category count, existence score, field measurement, experts score, and photo review and recheck (13,589 images). The results reveal the spatial distribution and differences in park quality, including six quality dimensions and five districts, and the proportion of the existing quality elements in 100 parks. Based on the results, the spatial areas (Barren area, Low-quality area, Medium-quality area, and High-quality area) are identified, which leads to the establishment of the improvement strategies of spatial equity regarding multi-quality parks. The results can help improve the assessment index system of urban parks, guide the landscape planning and design of urban parks for sustainability, as well as provide a reference for future environmental and social equity development, so as to provide insight and reference for decision-makers and designers considering the landscape planning and design of parks."

Neilson; Philip A. Wiebe,"Restoration is moving towards a more mechanistic approach that emphasizes restoration of ecosystem services. Trait-based approaches provide links between species identity and ecosystem functions and have been suggested as a promising way to formally integrate ecosystem services in the design of restoration programs. While practitioners have been routinely using informal knowledge on plant traits in their practices, these approaches are underutilized as operationalization remains challenging. The goal of this paper is to provide guidance for applied scientists and restoration practitioners looking to apply a trait-based approach to restore forest ecosystems. We present a five-step framework: 1) selection of services to be restored, 2) trait selection, 3) data acquisition, 4) analytical planning, and 5) empirical testing and monitoring. We use three Canadian case studies to illustrate the applicability of our framework and the variety of ways trait-based approaches can inform restoration practices: 1) restoration of urban woodlots after an insect outbreak, 2) restoration of a smelter damaged landscape surrounding an urban area, and 3) reclamation of remote upland forests after oil and gas related disturbances. We describe the major mechanisms and traits that determine vegetation effects on ecosystem services of importance in each case study. We then discuss data availability, methodological constraints, comparability issues, analytical methods, and the importance of empirical testing and monitoring to ensure realistic prediction of service restoration. By outlining issues and offering practical information, we aim to contribute to a more robust use of traits in ecological restoration."
An Innovative Collaboration-Based Ozone and Aerosol Observation Network in Northeast Asia,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e338f99208322624c9b0dcb5b265e6cd73f024d,Dongsheng Ji; Miao Zhang; Yu Liu; Yang Xu; Chunhua Cong; Jun He; Lili Wang; G. Tang; Zirui Liu; Wenkang Gao; Yan Li; Xiaolin Zhang; Jinmeng Cui; Jinmin Chen; Yuesi Wang,"
Situated in close proximity to the Korea Peninsula and the Japan Islands, Shandong Province in China (SDP) has emerged as a focal point for global attention due to its significant surface ozone (O3) and aerosol pollution. Despite this attention, there are notable gaps in knowledge across various interconnected research domains, encompassing climate change, atmospheric circulation, anthropogenic emissions, and the chemistry of O3 and aerosols. The impact of frequent heat waves on regional O3 and aerosol pollution remains unclear, while our comprehension of atmospheric circulation dynamics and the chemistry involved with O3 and aerosols is still hampered by substantial limitations. The unique topography and geographical setting of SDP, with its complex interplay of factors like sea–land breezes, mountain–valley winds, and urban heat islands, make it an ideal location for investigating the dynamics of O3 and aerosol chemistry. Moreover, it is essential to explore the effects of transboundary transport on O3 and aerosol pollution and delve into the underlying mechanisms contributing to their combined pollution effects. To bridge these knowledge gaps, the Innovative Collaboration-Based Ozone and Aerosol Observation Network in Northeast Asia has been established through collaborative efforts involving the Bureaus of Ecology and Environment, Meteorology in SDP, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This network encompasses various components, including air quality and weather stations, a network of low-cost air quality sensors, monitoring stations focused on atmospheric photochemical smog and aerosol chemical speciation, and vertical measurement systems targeting O3 and its precursor gases (utilizing light detection and ranging, balloon sounding, and drone-based measurements), as well as measurements conducted via vehicles and ships. Additionally, preliminary findings from this comprehensive observational campaign will be shared."
Optimization of Wetland Plant Selection and Configuration in Urban Water Environment Ecological Restoration Projects,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e455614c0a04c6bdc3850ad4f870f1a23cef1fb,Junyi Huang; Guan Wang,"In urban water ecological restoration projects, the selection and configuration of wetland plants are crucial for water quality improvement, ecological diversity enhancement, and landscape beautification. Different plants have different characteristics, and a scientific and rational selection and optimization of plant species is needed. This paper proposes an optimized plant selection and configuration scheme for urban water ecological restoration based on the ecological characteristics and pollutant removal performance of wetland plants. It analyzes the diversity, removal mechanisms, and configuration modes of wetland plants, taking into account ecology, aesthetics, and cost-effectiveness, to provide scientific evidence for wetland plant configuration and support water environment management decision-making."

O’Riain; C. Kerr-Smith; S. Hailes; M. Holton; P. Hopkins; Andrew J. King,"Understanding the behavioral ecology of wildlife that experiences negative interactions with humans and the outcome of any wildlife management intervention is essential. In the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) search for anthropogenic food sources in both urban and agricultural areas. In response, the city of Cape Town and private farmers employ “rangers” to keep baboons within the Table Mountain National Park. In this study, we investigated the success of rangers' intervention in keeping baboons in their natural habitat. Based on our findings in year one, we recommended adjustments to the rangers' management strategy in year two. We recommended improved consensus of actions toward baboons (that is, when/where to herd them), and the construction of a baboon‐proof fence around one of the farms that provided a corridor to urban areas. During the 2 months following recommendations, these interventions combined resulted in a significant reduction in the time baboons spent in both urban and agricultural land. Our case study illustrates the importance of integrating research findings into ongoing management actions to improve both human livelihoods and baboon conservation through an adaptive management framework. We expect similar approaches to be beneficial in a wide range of species and contexts."

(Viscaceae), displays a rapid and remarkable expansion into natural and urban ecosystems in Ukraine. The monitoring and management of this quickly spreading species is becoming increasingly difficult as new plant species become hosts. Unlike other local mistletoe species, the European mistletoe has a broad distribution and thus requires a countrywide pest status assessment for control. This review outlines the major taxonomic and evolutionary issues pertinent to V. album with an emphasis on the characters used to distinguish its five currently recognized subspecies. The review also provides an updated distribution map and host range for the three V. album subspecies in Ukraine [V. album subsp. album, V. album subsp. abietis (Wiesb.) Janch., and V. album subsp. austriacum (Wiesb.) Vollm.], addressing the current knowledge of their biology and ecology. A significant portion of the paper is devoted to the diversity of organisms associated with V. album, including herbivores, endophytes, and parasites, drawing particular attention to major pollination and dispersal vectors, as well as potential biocontrol agents for this mistletoe species."
A systematic review and meta‐analysis on urban arthropod diversity,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e59bd07c6920244273baf404da6e85b7ea84b14,O. Sanllorente; Endika Blanco‐Urdillo; A. Sánchez‐Tójar; Juan Diego Ibáñez‐Álamo,"
Urbanization is rapidly expanding at the global level, a phenomenon often reported to exert negative effects on biodiversity. However, many important knowledge gaps about the effect of urbanization on biodiversity remain, posing important conservation challenges.
This is especially true for certain taxonomic groups like arthropods, despite being the most diverse and abundant animal group on Earth. Here, we conduct an exhaustive systematic literature review and meta‐analysis to assess whether and how urbanization is negatively associated with arthropod diversity.
We explored potential geographic, temporal and taxonomic biases in the availability of evidence. In addition, we make use of meta‐analysis of variance to investigate whether urban areas across the world show similar patterns of arthropod diversity change.
Our results support previous studies; urbanization and arthropod diversity are negatively associated. However, not all arthropod groups seem to respond similarly (e.g., Odonata) potentially suggesting the importance of implementing taxa‐specific conservation actions in urban areas.
On the other hand, our meta‐analysis of variance showed higher variance in arthropod diversity in urban compared to non‐urban habitats, suggesting great potential for the implementation of certain city conservation practices or attributes to promote arthropod communities.
Last, we identified several key taxonomic and geographic biases that require additional scientific attention as well as strong evidence for negative‐effects publication bias in the literature.
Our results highlight the importance of urban ecology research for helping design more diverse urban ecosystems.

Sand flies were collected monthly from May 2018 to April 2019 using automatic light traps for 3 consecutive nights. Eight houses were selected as sample points due its previous reports of tegumentary leishmaniasis and/or canine leishmaniasis. The sand fly’s fauna found on the present study it’s represented by several medical importance species and the most abundant species found were Lutzomyia longipalpis (77.09%) and Nyssomyia intermedia (10.06%). Leishmania infantum DNA was detected in a pool of Lu. longipalpis resulting on a 2.81% of infection rate. By the frequency of the two most abundant species on this study, we developed a risk area map and it draws attention to sample point 6 due to disparate abundance of sand flies at this site (81.81%). Statistical overview shows Lu. longipalpis as dominant species and, still, Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling analysis reveal high similarity on fauna’s diversity on the study area. Our findings suggest that the diversity of sand flies from the municipality of Lassance may promote the circulation of Leishmania infantum parasites putting in risk the habitants and other mammal’s species. Still, our study reinforces the necessity of specific studies focused on breed sites of phlebotomine and its’ ecology to expand the knowledge about the behaviour of this group of insects applying directly to leishmaniases’ epidemiology."
Cyanobacterial blooms contribute to the diversity of antibiotic-resistance genes in aquatic ecosystems,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e6ac98c57792ed51567f46f17786453968e684e,Qi Zhang; Zhenyan Zhang; Tao Lu; W.

Zhou; Jianqiang Su; Haifeng Qian,"Cyanobacterial blooms are a global ecological problem that directly threatens human health and crop safety. Cyanobacteria have toxic effects on aquatic microorganisms, which could drive the selection for resistance genes. The effect of cyanobacterial blooms on the dispersal and abundance of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) of concern to human health remains poorly known. We herein investigated the effect of cyanobacterial blooms on ARG composition in Lake Taihu, China. The numbers and relative abundances of total ARGs increased obviously during a Planktothrix bloom. More pathogenic microorganisms were present during this bloom than during a Planktothrix bloom or during the non-bloom period. Microcosmic experiments using additional aquatic ecosystems (an urban river and Lake West) found that a coculture of Microcystis aeruginosa and Planktothrix agardhii increased the richness of the bacterial community, because its phycosphere provided a richer microniche for bacterial colonization and growth. Antibiotic-resistance bacteria were naturally in a rich position, successfully increasing the momentum for the emergence and spread of ARGs. These results demonstrate that cyanobacterial blooms are a crucial driver of ARG diffusion and enrichment in freshwater, thus providing a reference for the ecology and evolution of ARGs and ARBs and for better assessing and managing water quality. Qi Zhang, Zhenyan Zhang et al. show that the numbers and relative abundance of antibiotics-resistance genes increase during a cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Taihu of China. This correlation provides insights to the ecologists and the policy makers who manage the quality of fresh water."

Urban political ecology in prospect and retrospect,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e7e6a5de551b609d2c978f81f3286ff26d13bd9,M. Gandy,"The contemporary theorization of the urban biosphere has reached something of an impasse between the perceived limitations of urban political ecology, the neo-Lefebvrian emphasis on global patterns of urbanization, and the rise of “new materialisms”.  Since its emergence in the mid-1990s, urban political ecology has made a series of distinctive contributions to the study of urban environmental issues yet in recent years a series of conceptual tensions and empirical lacunae have become apparent.  In this essay I reflect on the legacy of the “first wave” of urban political ecology scholarship and consider a series of contemporary challenges including more complex interpretations of agency, materiality, and subjectivity.

"Formation Process and Spatial Representation of Tourist Destination Personality from the Perspective of Cultural Heritage: Application in Traditional Villages in Ancient Huizhou, China",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e8bb259ba141413be9438598c47bb3be26e5253,Kai Ren; Jin Xu,"Tourism destinations are cultural heritage and spatial landscape systems of organic coexistence between humans and the Earth, and are formed through the long historical evolution of a specific geographical environment. With the development of large-scale cultural and tourism projects and the construction of scenic areas, many tourist destinations face conflicts between people and the environment and the crisis of discontinuity in the landscape and the cultural context. The concept of tourist destination personality provides a perspective for studying the interaction between humans and the environment in tourist destinations. However, existing research has not delved into the mechanisms of temporal–spatial interaction and spatial representation of regional cultural heritage in regional systems. Therefore, from the perspectives of geography and urban–rural planning, this study selects traditional villages in ancient Huizhou as the research object and employs relevant theories from cultural ecology to construct a paradigm for analyzing the formation path of tourist destination personality based on a cultural core from a regional systemic perspective. Building on this, this study develops a coupling analysis framework for the “accumulation anchoring” of heritage landscape representation in traditional villages in ancient Huizhou based on a cognitive understanding of tourist destination heritage landscape and a ‘time–space’ interactive model. The research reveals that the formation of personality in traditional villages in ancient Huizhou centers around cultural cores such as production methods, social organizations, construction mechanisms, and social beliefs. It is driven by basic forces such as resource endowment vitality, a social structure driving force, and a historical choice regulatory force, with the logic of forming dominant functions and obtaining expected benefits such as the core. The spatial representation of traditional village heritage in ancient Huizhou exhibits a synergistic evolution mechanism between ‘culture and landscape’. The research process and conclusions provide a basic framework and methodological system for the study of tourist destination personality and heritage revitalization, expanding the understanding of the process of human–environment interaction and spatial patterns in tourist destinations."
STATE OF THE MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL COMPONENTS IN THE REST AREAS OF KIZLYAR AND ITS SURROUNDINGS,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e99172bae0c179e8f0319d91af864573fd3e574,M. Magomedov,"Revealing the limits of stability of natural complexes is an important task in modern urban ecology, where structural indicators of natural components, their state, and dynamics are taken as indicators. The aim of the work was to identify changes in the state of soil, vegetation and rodents in the vicinity of Kizlyar, Republic of Dagestan, caused by recreational activities. The beginning of the tourist season fell on the end of March and lasted until mid-autumn. One of the consequences of the recreational load is the compaction of the surface soil horizons, which occurs under the influence of trampling. It was revealed that under conditions of a recreational load, the hardness of the surface soil horizons was 1.7 times higher than in the control plot. Such changes in soil hardness have an impact on plant associations and, directly or indirectly, on the state of the community of murine rodents, due to their land-burrowing way of life. On the recreational site, there was a decrease in both the total number of species and the proportion of native plant species, represented mostly by meadow weed and ruderal species, while an increase in the projective cover and phytomass was noted, which may be associated with an increase in illumination. Meanwhile, the thinning of the tree layer was also noted. On both sites, 4 species of rodents were recorded. The number of yellow-bellied mice in the control plot was 2.5 times higher than in the recreational plot; public voles in the recreational plot were six times less than in the recreational plot. Forest dormouse in the recreational area - 6, on the control - 8 individuals. There are 5 individuals of the gray hamster in the recreational area, and 7 individuals in the control area. The revealed differences in the functioning of the considered natural components in the conditions of recreational nature management, apparently, is their adaptive response to environmental changes caused by resting people, mainly manifested in the form of soil compaction and disturbance."

No entanto, o rompimento desse ciclo, com a predominância da economia sobre os outros dois elementos, conduz ao desequilíbrio ambiental, com consequências desastrosas para as sociedades humanas e para o planeta como um todo. O presente artigo tem por objetivo principal analisar as causas e efeitos do rompimento desse equilíbrio no contexto dos desastres humanos de natureza social ocorridos em Mariana-MG (2015) e Brumadinho-MG (2019), e como objetivo secundário, discutir soluções plausíveis para se restabelecer esse elo. Como resultado, aponta a importância de se buscar respostas a partir da interconexão dos valores biológicos, econômicos e éticos tendo por instrumento o direito e as políticas públicas. A análise envolve o emprego do método qualitativo, exploratório-bibliográfico, segundo a ótica dos impactos ambientais/urbanísticos, com enfoque na avaliação ex post. Como conclusão, sustenta-se o desenvolvimento de políticas públicas, designadamente urbanísticas voltadas à preservação do meio ambiente, bem como à responsabilização dos empresários da mineração pelos danos decorrentes do rompimento de barragens de rejeito como forma de restauração do ciclo ecologia-economia-ética nos ambientes urbanos que suportaram os desastres humanos em questão.Palavras-chave: Ecologia e ética; Barragens de rejeito; Desastres; Direito urbanístico; Impactos ambientais urbanísticos.  Abstract The harmonious approach towards the ecology-economics-ethics circle allows paradigm broadening that leads to interdisciplinary solutions that can balance the relationship between the environment and human activities. However, whenever there is a break in this circle, with the predominance of the economy over the other two elements, it leads to environmental imbalance, with disastrous consequences for human societies and for the planet as a whole. This paper aims to analyze the causes and effects towards the disruption of this balance in the context of the human social natural disasters that happened in the cities of Mariana (2015) and Brumadinho (2019), both located in the state of Minas Gerais. As a result, the text highlights the importance of seeking solutions for the reconstitution of this link, based on the interconnection of biological, economic and ethical values. The study involves the qualitative exploratory-bibliographic method considering the perspective of urban environmental/urban impacts and focuses on the ex post evaluation. As a conclusion, this article presents a reflection upon solutions that include the development of urban public policies aimed at preserving the environment, as well as the responsibility of mining entrepreneurs for the damages resulting from the rupture of waste dams as a way of reestablishing the ecology-economics-ethics circle in the urban environment that have borne the human disasters in analyses.Keywords: Ecology and Ethics; Waste dams; Disasters; Urban law; Urban environmental impacts."
"Quantitative Evaluation of the Integrity of Natural Ecosystems and Anthropogenic Impacts in Shennongjia National Park, China",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ef351177d5cad880ae7f6736b30258cf94da373,Zhihao Huang; Jia-shuo Cao; Yang Peng; K. Ma; G. Cui,"China launched its pilot national park system in 2015, and Shennongjia National Park has attracted much attention as one of the first batch of pilot national parks. The primary goal of national park construction in China is to effectively protect the integrity and authenticity of nationally important natural ecosystems. Based on the theory of landscape ecology, this study interpreted data from high-resolution remote sensing images and used landscape pattern analysis, spatial correlation analysis, and geographic weighted regression analysis to quantitatively evaluate the integrity of natural ecosystems at the landscape scale. A more accurate and operable calculation method was proposed to analyze the spatial variation in natural ecosystem integrity and to explore the scope and intensity of the impact of different anthropogenic activities on natural ecosystem integrity. The results showed that: (1) from the perspective of the spatial distribution patterns of natural ecosystem integrity, the degree of natural ecosystem integrity of Shennongjia National Park was generally high, with an integrity index value of 96.06, and the proportion of high-integrity areas accounted for 72.38%. The integrity index value of the strict protection zone was 98.83, and the proportion of the low-integrity index area only accounted for 0.01% of the strict protection zone, which was mainly distributed in the main urban areas of the nearby townships and along the highways in the national park, as well as in other areas with intensive anthropogenic activities. (2) From the perspective of the degree of impact of anthropogenic activities on natural ecosystem integrity, population density (0.3344), traffic accessibility (0.2389), traditional utilization activities (0.1101), and industrial and mining activities (0.0095) were, in descending order, the most impactful, and there was no significant correlation between ecotourism activities and natural ecosystem integrity. (3) From the perspective of the impact range of anthropogenic activities on natural ecosystem integrity, traditional utilization activities had the largest impact, accounting for 19.71% of the total area of the national park. The area affected by population density accounted for 1.52%. Industrial and mining activities had an influence of 4.75%, and the area affected by traffic accessibility accounted for 9.28%. Through conducting quantitative research into the integrity of natural ecosystems in Shennongjia National Park, this study provides a new research paradigm for the conservation of natural ecosystems and for the sustainable development of resources in protected areas, which is of great significance for the sensible development of national park conservation and management."

Under what conditions does agonism lead to productive outcomes, expand participation and social inclusion? In this paper, we highlight key insights and issues emerging from three case studies, where design practitioners engaged in PD projects for urban and cultural transformation in New York City and Cambridge. Wide-ranging interviews and participatory workshops reveal how PD is transformed by different “ecologies” inherent in the socio-cultural conditions, power relations, design constraints, and intrinsic values of practitioners grappling with contestation and seeking to engage agonistic pluralism."
Extraction and Analysis of Finer Impervious Surface Classes in Urban Area,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ef94e009886af6fdb279b4584cdd071cdd12ad1,Wenyue Liao; Yingbin Deng; Miao Li; Meiwei Sun; Ji Yang; Jianhui Xu,"Impervious surfaces (IS), the most common land cover in urban areas, not only provide convenience to the city, but also exert significant negative environmental impacts, thereby affecting the ecological environment carrying capacity of urban agglomerations. Most of the current research considers IS as a single land-cover type, yet this does not fully reflect the complex physical characteristics of various IS types. Therefore, limited information for urban micro-ecology and urban fine management can be provided through one IS land-cover type. This study proposed a finer IS classification scheme and mapped the detailed IS fraction in Guangzhou City, China using Landsat imagery. The IS type was divided into seven finer classes, including blue steel, cement, asphalt, other impervious surface, and other metal, brick, and plastic. Classification results demonstrate that finer IS can be well extracted from the Landsat imagery as all root mean square errors (RMSE) are less than 15%. Specially, the accuracies of asphalt, plastic, and cement are better than other finer IS types with the RMSEs of 7.99%, 8.48%, and 9.92%, respectively. Quantitative analyses illustrate that asphalt, other impervious surface, and brick are the dominant IS types in the study area with the percentages of 9.68%, 6.27%, and 4.45%, respectively, and they are mainly located in Yuexiu, Liwan, Haizhu, and Panyu districts. These results are valuable for research into urban fine management and can support the detailed analysis of urban micro-ecology."
[Relationship between economy and ecology of Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration based on ecological footprint of net primary productivity].,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0efc01f1ea9b7529deb9bfb4f546e0b66738deff,Y. Ao; Mengtian Zhang; Yongyu Zhao; Xiao-Feng Wang; Zhao-di Bai; Ling-Feng Jiang,"With the acceleration of regional economic integration, human activities have played an increasingly crucial role in regional sustainable development. In this study, MODIS remote sensing data and ecological footprint of net primary productivity (EF-NPP) were leveraged to calculate the equivalence factor and yield factor of the six major biologically productive land areas in the Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration. We analyzed the changes in per capita ecological footprint, per capita ecological carrying capacity, natural resource utilization efficiency and ecological moderate population from 2000 to 2020. Results showed that the per capita ecological footprint in the Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration continued to rise from 2000 to 2020. The ecological occupation of energy land was the highest. The ecological footprint was high in west, low in middle, and higher in northwest of the study area. The per capita ecological carrying capacity was relatively high in Zhaoqing and Jiangmen and low in Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan and Zhongshan. The gap between the ecological moderate population and the regional actual population widened over time, reaching 30.62 million in 2020. The regional actual population was much larger than the ecological moderate population, indicating huge population pressure. The natural resource utilization efficiency of the three main industries was high. The economic benefits created by the per capita ecological footprint increased by 36800 yuan·hm-2 during the research period, with an average annual growth rate of 1800 yuan·hm-2. The growth rate of the tertiary industry was the highest. Therefore, the results could provide reference for the study on natural resource utilization efficiency in medium and small-scale regions."

Education involves practical courses aimed at consolidation of the skills for plant identification, phyto indexing and formulation of recommendations on environmental optimization. It is shown that the application of interdisciplinary approach to the formation of universal competence through learning botany is relevant."
Vegetal Agency in Street Tree Stewardship Practices: People-Plant Involutions Within Urban Green Infrastructure in New York City,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f6dab7dd24aedbbefb63ffb5501165f1e58ca41,M. Maurer,"In cities nature is taking on a new role as infrastructure, providing essential services in terms of temperature regulation and water management, as well as the provision of habitat for biodiversity conservation. With this turn to green infrastructure have come new challenges to maintenance. Plants are lively things and if they are to perform their infrastructural roles they must be routinely tended to in particular ways. In the context of neoliberal governance, much of this labor falls to volunteer humans. Framed as stewardship, this volunteerism for plant-city thriving is posited as a way to meet maintenance needs while promoting human health and well-being and creating support for nature-based solutions through a sense of ownership and responsibility. While it is thus possible to read stewardship as an enrollment of people and plants into the reproduction of neoliberal urban political ecologies, in this paper I argue that such an analysis overlooks the involution of plants and people that occurs during acts of stewardship. Drawing on ethnographic research with street tree stewards in New York City I explore how vegetal agency draws people into affective, embodied relations. During acts of stewardship, trees act on people and reconfigure their relations in ways that potentially exceed the strictures of stewardship. Rather than allowing stewardship discourses and critiques thereof to be our sole frame for understanding these people-plant relations, we should also consider them from the perspective of vegetal agency and what human-tree involutions do within, around, and to human practices of stewardship."
The Turn to Indigenization in Canadian Writing: Kinship Ethics and the Ecology of Knowledges,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f6ee4c518ff759382e6acd09044acf53a86c02e,A. Marcos,"This article heeds the recent shift in cultural criticism and creative writing toward imagining ""a functional ecology of knowledges in Canada"" (Coleman, ""Toward"" 8) that takes its conceptual lead from Indigenous epistemologies. Through close reading Thomas King's novel The Back of the Turtle (2014), Wayde Compton's short story collection The Outer Harbour (2014), and Daniel Coleman's nonfiction book Yardwork: A Biography of an Urban Place (2017), the article connects Indigenous notions of kinship to the turn to trans-systemic epistemologies in contemporary Canadian literature and criticism. My analysis draws on Indigenous theories of kinship underlying Indigenous resurgence and decolonization and sets them in conversation with King's reflections on storytelling and world-building, Compton's theoretical charting of African Canadian space as Afroperipheral within diaspora criticism, and Coleman's self-retraining to redefine settler belonging and knowledge. This analysis concludes that, by promoting an awareness of the interdependence between the natural environment, humans, and other-than-human beings that is central to Indigenous epistemologies, these works contribute to the shift toward the construction of an ecology of knowledges and hold the potential for renewed decolonizing efforts, social justice, and environmental sustainability."
Bee community response to local and landscape factors along an urban-rural gradient,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f8a32a60ff57e012b93892a8a03f0722fb0a907,Kristen R. Birdshire; Adrian L. Carper; C. Briles,"Over a third of the world’s crops require insect pollination, and reliance on pollination services for food continues to rise as human populations increase. Furthermore, as interest in urban agriculture has grown, so has a need for studies of urban pollinator ecology and pollination. Analyzing pollinator assemblages along a rural-urban gradient provides powerful mechanistic insight into how urbanization impacts pollinators. Yet, studies examining pollinators along urban-rural gradients are limited and results vary. Since pollinators vary tremendously in life history characteristics and respond to urbanization differently, studies from different regions would improve our understanding of pollinator response to urbanization. This study documents different bee assemblages along a high-plains semi-arid urban-rural gradient in Denver, Colorado, USA. Percent impervious surface was used to define the extent of urbanization at 12 sites and local and landscape characteristics were estimated using field assessments and geospatial analysis. Wild bees were collected and the relationships between urbanization and bee communities were explored using linear modeling. Overall, bee abundance and diversity decreased with increasing urbanization, suggesting that urban areas negatively impact bee communities. However, all bee guilds responded positively to local floral richness and negatively to the degree of landscape urbanization, suggesting that different types of bees responded similarly to urbanization. These findings suggest that providing a greater diversity of floral resources is key to mitigating the negative impacts of urbanization on pollinator communities."

Arhun; A. Hnatov; V. Mygal; S. Khodyriev; A. Popova; H. Hnatova,"One of the main steps to improve the ecology of large cities is to abandon the use of internal combustion engine transport in favors of electric buses (EB). The main objective of this work is to unite alternative sources of electricity generation, both on board the bus and in the transport infrastructure, for fast charging/recharging of EB with ultracapacitor-based energy storage unit. Comparison of the costs of introducing a new EB route and a trolleybus was carried out. It was determined that the total cost of the trolleybus route is approximately 2.65 times higher. Requirements for alternative electricity generation systems (EE) for charging urban EBs on board and in transport infrastructure were formulated. A method of creating an integrated system of alternative sources of electricity generation (ASEG) for urban passenger transport was developed in the EB and the transport infrastructure for charging urban EB. The possibility of application of alternative energy sources in transport infrastructure and in electric buses is studied. In addition, the energy balance in EE has been drawn up taking into account ASGEE. The presented results are the basis for the development of a business project for the introduction of environmentally friendly transport in large cities."

But most of the time, students study in urban centers, and more and more schools have closed in the countryside. A problem that needs to be urgently revised. The present work aims to analyze the education focused on the peasant cultural reality, from rural students in Ribeirão do Eixo, Itabirito municipality, in the state of Minas Gerais, as a possible means of building agricultural sustainability. The ""Municipal Rural School of Ribeirão do Eixo"", part of the board of educational establishments of the Municipal Secretariat of Education of Itabirito MG is legally under the responsibility of the 15th Regional Superintendence of Education of Ouro Preto and is located at the Federal Highway BR 040, km 589, between the settlements of Ribeirão and the Eixo, rural area of the district of São Gonçalo do Bação. The school's director answers for the other 06 municipal rural schools in Itabirito. The school staff consists of 08 professionals, who are directly in the School, with 06 teachers being 03 with graduation and 03 with post-graduation, 01 general services auxiliary and 01 school staff, both responsible for cleaning and food; And a secretary and a pedagogical supervisor who follow up with the distance that compose together with the director, the Team responsible for 06 Municipal Rural Schools of the Municipality. The School works in the morning shift and offers only Infant Education and Elementary Education (1st to 5th year) with students distributed in 06 classes. The school institution serves approximately 40 enrolled and frequent students from Ribeirão do Eixo and its surroundings, in only 1 shift, with 11 students in early childhood education (1st and 2nd R. gest. sust. ambient., Florianópolis, v. 9, n. 1, p. 483-512, jan/mar. 2020. 485 grades), 06 students in the 1st year, 07 students in the 2nd year, 06 students in the 3rd year, 06 students in the 4th year and 04 students in the 5th year. In this context, the location listed for study clearly denotes the complexity of the field / city relationship, since it is a rural area in the process of urbanization and industrialization, being incorporated to the metropolitan south axis. Thus, from the rural education as an instrument of valorization of the rural space, the reality of the rural school of the locality is presented and understood as a means of social transformation proposing its resignification within the scope of the local community. The main proposal is based on offering new teaching and qualification modalities, through the provision of technical courses in the areas of agriculture, ecology and tourism, bringing about new perspectives of sustainability for a transition territory with endangered landscapes and ignored and / or unknown potentials"
"Importance of microenvironment to arbovirus vector distribution in an urban area, São Paulo, Brazil",2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0fa5e61f029fe9143f55082ad8b54e2b0e7726a8,M. B. Arduino; L. F. Mucci; Luciana Mamede Dos Santos; Marilena Fogaça de Souza Soares,"Abstract INTRODUCTION: The study of the landscape ecology, biological microhabitat, and epidemiological implications for the distribution of the main vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus contribute to the prevention and control actions regarding the diseases they transmit. METHODS: This study sought to assess data on positive properties of the vector control program activities from 1998 to 2010. An entomological survey was also carried out on a sample of buildings collecting larvae and pupae from containers between October and April (spring / summer) from 2002 to 2005. We assessed the physico-chemical data of the water in 20% of positive containers. The vegetation and urbanization were assessed with the aid of satellite images and microenvironments were classified as urbanized, woods, and shrubs. The data were analyzed using statistical and geoprocessing software. RESULTS: Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus colonized all types of microhabitats and microenvironments, predominantly in the urbanized area, in isolation and in coexistence. The microhabitat of Ae. aegypti showed a temperature gradient greater than that of Ae. albopictus, and there was an association with urbanized areas for the first species and wooded areas for the last species. CONCLUSIONS: Landscape ecology and intra-urban differences favor different microclimates, which contribute to the coexistence of species in the urban environment in an area close to the forest, raising the risk of other arbovirus infections in urban areas. The ecological niche should be considered for Ae. albopictus. Entomological and virologic monitoring are suggested as arbovirus surveillance actions in urban infested centers near preserved forests."
"Environmental filtering and spatial processes equally contributed to macroinvertebrate metacommunity dynamics in the highly urbanized river networks in Shenzhen, South China",2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0fa617ca2ec661cd2740cc44daa15ab30efad00d,Zhenyuan Liu; Ting Zhou; Yongde Cui; Zhengfei Li; Weimin Wang; Yushun Chen; Zhicai Xie,"Background Disentangling the relative roles of environmental filtering and spatial processes in structuring ecological communities is a central topic in metacommunity ecology. Metacommunity ecology in the temperate river ecosystems has been well developed, while less attention has been paid to subtropical urban river networks. Here, we examined the ecological factors and seasonal difference in structuring macroinvertebrates metacommunity assembly in the subtropical urban river networks in Shenzhen, South China. Results Our results revealed that there was no significant distinction of macroinvertebrate community composition among seasons, with only the relative abundance of Mollusca and Odonata significantly differed in both wet and dry seasons. One possible explanation was that most macroinvertebrates are generally pollution-tolerant taxa characterized with nonseasonal life cycle. In addition, distance-based redundancy analysis and variation partitioning approach revealed that metacommunity was determined equally by the environmental and dispersal-related factors. Further, our results showed that, although a slight temporal variation of relative contribution, the identity and explanation power of ecological factors were different among seasons. Specifically, stronger environmental filtering structuring community dynamics was observed in the dry than wet seasons, which might be owing to higher environmental heterogeneity under a low water-flow condition. Moreover, we detected that the influence of spatial processes was stronger in the wet than dry seasons, indicating an obvious dispersal processes due to high connectivity among sites. Conclusion Overall, our results revealed that environmental and spatial factors equally explained variations of macroinvertebrate metacommunity, implying the necessity of considering dispersal-related processes structuring ecological communities in river bioassessment programs. Moreover, degraded habitat conditions and water quality were the predominant factors that affected macroinvertebrate communities, indicating the significance and feasibility of improving local abiotic conditions to sustain local biodiversity. Further, our findings revealed the importance of seasonal dynamics of these urban river networks in structuring macroinvertebrate metacommunity. Thereby, our study improves the understanding of ecological processes governing macroinvertebrate metacommunity and underlines the idea that community ecology studies should go beyond the single snapshot survey in river networks."
Promoting urban ecological resilience through the lens of avian biodiversity,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0fb0eb7cefcc2878f167bf3f790e4d6d790d4f91,Michael W D McCloy; R. K. Andringa; T. Maness; Jennifer A. Smith; Jacquelyn K. Grace; Ayyoob Shari ﬁ; Elizabeth Mojica,"The significance of urban landscapes in safeguarding biodiversity is often disregarded, even though a considerable amount of conservation focus is directed toward biodiversity hotspots where urban land conversion is happening at the fastest pace. Maintaining biodiversity in urban areas not only benefits the environment, but along with social, economic, and technological factors can increase the stability of urban systems to disturbance, a concept known as “urban resilience”. In this synthesis paper, we explore the ecological dimension of urban resilience and specifically focus on avian biodiversity because birds are easy to observe, relatively abundant, and can serve as an indicator of the overall health of urban environments. We first examine the concept of ecological resilience and discuss the role of environmental stressors associated with urbanization in the ongoing avian biodiversity crisis. We then provide an overview of characteristics of the urban environment that may promote ecological resilience in birds, and associations between social and economic factors and urban ecological resilience. Finally, we provide recommendations on future research regarding strategies to improve urban ecological resilience and thus, urban resilience as a whole, at the intersections of urban ecology, ecosystem ecology, environmental justice, and urban planning. Since 68% of the world’s population is projected to live in urban areas by 2050, it is imperative that scientists, urban planners, civil engineers, architects, and others consider urban ecological resilience as a dimension of both environmental health and the resilience of cities to future natural and anthropogenic stressors."

The research included two species of tinder fungus widely spread in the Northern hemisphere: Fomes fomentarius (L.) Fr. (confined to various hardwoods, mostly birch) and Fomitopsis pinicola (Sw.) P. Karst. (confined to trees of various species). Both species of fungi are facultative parasites. The research showed that these species of fungi use quite a restricted set of host substrates showing a pretty narrow range of trophic preferences, despite the presence of numerous species of trees suitable for them at the surveyed area. F. fomentarius uses birch, poplar and aspen as a substrate within the researched area. It is very rarely found at other wood species. The trophic range of the highly eurytrophic species F. pinicola is represented here mostly by a few coniferous species, such as pine, fir and spruce tree. This fungus is present at birch trees and aspen much more rarely. These species of tinder fungi were not found at other wood species of the surveyed area. F. fomentarius is very often found at birches in the areas with minimal anthropogenic load (in «Stolby» nature reserve) and becomes less numerous with the increasing manthropogenic load. The situation is the contrary with poplar: F. fomentarius is rarely found at poplar in the areas with low or medium anthropogenic load, but often destroys poplar wood in the areas with the increased anthropogenic load (within the green space of urban areas). Moreover, F. fomentarius is often found in parklands, rather than along the roadside lanes. F. pinicola is typical for ecosystems with low anthropogenic load and prefers coniferous wood species. It is mostly found in ecosystems of “Stolby” natural reserve, mainly on fir and pine species."
A boundary enhancement loss function for semantic segmentation of land cover,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0fb802e4ac8673c0e38e9265882f890c878dbd53,Jin Wang; N. Ding; Guangjun He,"ABSTRACT With the rapid development of UAV remote sensing, satellite remote sensing and computer vision, the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images has also developed rapidly and is widely used in research on land utilization classification, ecology, urban planning and other problems. Large differences in spatial and temporal scales, different image resolutions, insufficient model robustness to the data domain, and blurred object boundaries are the main problems for existing semantic segmentation models based on deep learning. This paper studies the problem of blurred target boundaries after semantic segmentation and propose a boundary enhancement loss function that highlights the importance of target edges. Compared to other models used in investigating higher boundary accuracy, the proposed model can be trained without boundary-labelled data, and no additional inference time is consumed. This loss function is applied to some other deep learning networks as a plug-and-play module on two different datasets and show that the IoU has an improvement of 2–5% with better clear boundary and continuity, which is more prominent on buildings and roads."
"Financial Development, Environmental Regulations and Green Economic Transition",2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0fb99769973aa01772e52a6871e1a7ddd18bab1e,Zhang Jianpeng; C. Shiyi,"With the global deterioration of ecology and the widening of inequality, achieving green, inclusive and sustainable economic growth has received worldwide recognition. The essence of green transition is the revolution of development mode, which requires a large amount of environmental investment, including enterprise pollution control and green RD on the other hand, the supply capacity of green funds by the financial sector also needs to be improved, so as to reduce the environmental financing constraints faced by enterprises. Therefore, financial development and environmental regulations can produce synergy at both ends of supply and demand of environmental investment and have a coordination effect on green economic transition. This paper exploits a comprehend dataset on the information of industrial production, pollution emission and green innovation of 284 cities in China from 2004 to 2015 to test the coordination effect. In recent years, the innovation and development of China’s financial system are reflected in local small financial institutions, in which the development of city commercial banks (CCB) has become an important symbol. With information advantages, more flexible supervision and diversified ownership structure, CCB can reduce information asymmetry in the lending process and alleviate the financing constraints faced by enterprises. Measuring the urban financial development based on the increase in the branches of CCB, this paper finds that local financial development can significantly reduce the industrial SO2 emission, the main pollutant in cities, in coordination with environmental regulations. The mechanism analysis shows that financial development and environmental regulations can synergistically promote industrial pollution control and green technological innovation, which reduces the emission intensity of industrial pollution and promotes the rise of green industry, thus promoting industrial green transition, without significant reduction of production. The conclusions remain stable after a series of endogenous and robustness tests. Heterogeneity analysis also reveals that environmental information asymmetry, the shortage of market intermediary service agency and the weak of the ability of technology commercialization will impair the coordination effect. The contributions of this paper are mainly reflected in two aspects: First, it reveals the factor of financial development in affecting green economic transition, which enriches the existing literature on financing constraints, financial development and economic green transition, and also provides useful policy enlightenment for the development of green economy. It is necessary to not only strictly implement environmental regulations, but also pay attention to the financial support and guidance role of the financial sector, so as to promote enterprises’ pollution control and green R&D innovation. Second, to improve the supply capacity of green funds, China needs to not only deepen the reform of the financial system and make up for the shortcomings existing in the financial system, but also further improve the relevant supporting systems required for the development of green finance, including improving the enterprise environmental information disclosure and sharing mechanism, developing green financial intermediary service agency, and cultivating professional technical management talents, so as to improve the operational ability of green financial business during the supply of green funds."
Phantasmal ruralism: A terror of folk ecology in Washington Irving’s ‘The Legend of Sleepy Hollow’,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0fbac5b0e2141970923ef736b5a610e950c58132,Joshua Myers,"This article considers Washington Irving’s ‘The Legend of Sleepy Hollow’ as a work of nineteenth-century American folk horror for how the story’s depiction of nature suggests provincial people as an especially fearful collective entity. With additional consideration of Tim Burton’s film adaptation, Sleepy Hollow (1999), this article provides an ecocritical analysis of the tale’s landscapes and objects to assert that supernatural belief is manufactured partly by the idea of rural existence as physically and culturally separate from urban areas. Moreover, the article illustrates how reading the story’s phantasmal terrors as sourced by environmental catalysts can diminish hierarchies that are rooted in rural and urban dichotomies."

Evaluation Study on the Smart and Interactive Landscape Design of Haiyuntai Waterfront Park from the Perspective of a Sustainable City,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0fd7dbc1a6d97147270b4ae1b9174c4ec1c26b74,Jingwen Yuan; Zhixiang Wang; Siyan Xing; C. Kim,"With the rapid development of technological progress and smart city construction, the concept of sustainable cities is gradually being integrated into all aspects of urban construction. In this context, the public’s demand for high-quality and rich leisure experiences is increasing, and the design, management, and service standards of urban parks are also being upgraded. As an innovative product of the integration of ecological civilisation and information technology, smart interactive parks have become an important direction for promoting sustainable urban development, especially in the landscape design of waterside parks, which show unique significance. This study explores the application of the smart interactive concept in the landscape design of waterside parks from the perspective of sustainable cities, aiming to construct a set of evaluation frameworks to assess its effectiveness and value in urban development. Through in-depth analyses of the smart interaction concept and its application in landscape design, this study combines environmental psychology, landscape ecology, and GIS technology to propose innovative goals, strategies, and design methods for waterside smart interactive landscapes that can support the ecological and social needs of sustainable cities. Domestic and international case studies show that the successful application of smart interactive technologies in waterside parks not only improves environmental quality but also promotes economic development by enhancing the attractiveness of the parks, providing multiple values for sustainable cities. In the empirical research section, this paper takes Haeundae Waterside Park in South Korea as the object of investigation and constructs a design framework based on project selection and indicator quantification to further validate the effectiveness of the practical application of the smart interactive concept in waterside park landscape design. Based on the findings, this paper proposes a series of policy recommendations to promote the construction of smart interactive parks and sustainable urban development. These recommendations not only provide theoretical support for the future development of Haeundae Waterside Park but also provide a reference for the design and planning of public spaces in other cities around the world. By promoting the integration of smart interactive concepts with ecological sustainability, this study provides an innovative reference path for urban planners, landscape architects. and environmentalists to help realise the goal of a sustainable city with coordinated ecological, social, and economic development."
Evolution in Cities,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0fd8073c105345be5dc4cfc8f9a851a2f4a757cd,S. Diamond; Ryan Andrew Martin,"Although research performed in cities will not uncover new evolutionary mechanisms, it could provide unprecedented opportunities to examine the interplay of evolutionary forces in new ways and new avenues to address classic questions. However, while the variation within and among cities affords many opportunities to advance evolutionary biology research, careful alignment between how cities are used and the research questions being asked is necessary to maximize the insights that can be gained. In this review, we develop a framework to help guide alignment between urban evolution research approaches and questions. Using this framework, we highlight what has been accomplished to date in the field of urban evolution and identify several up-and-coming research directions for further expansion. We conclude that urban environments can be used as evolutionary test beds to tackle both new and long-standing questions in evolutionary biology. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, Volume 52 is November 2021.

A wizard of disquietude in our midst: Melanie Klein and the critical geographies of manic reparation,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0fe74fd188b432445943394fcd49d5abc81270b6,David K. Seitz,"This article invites critical geographers to reconsider the conceptual offerings of Austrian-British object-relations psychoanalyst Melanie Klein (1882–1960), whose metapsychology has had a significant but largely unacknowledged contemporary influence on the field via theorists like Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Lauren Berlant. Excavating the Kleinian genealogies of Sedgwick’s concept of “reparative reading” and Berlant’s notion of “cruel optimism,” I argue that geographers engaged with these ideas would benefit from a more sustained consideration of Klein’s influence on them. I then point to the potential utility for critical geographers of just one of many Kleinian concepts that has largely remained off the map of recent debates: ”manic reparation,” sometimes referred to as mock reparation or manic denial, which defends against the anxiety of wanting to repair a damaged object of attachment. Sketching possibilities for how this concept could productively illuminate concerns near and dear to critical geographers—such as the political ecologies of climate change, critiques of neoliberal multiculturalisms, debates over urban development, and abolition geographies—I argue that Klein’s idiosyncratic, though at times problematic and counterintuitive, body of work offers critical geographers an insightful, expansive, and underutilized conceptual vocabulary for examining the affective dimensions of a wide range of political formations."

Perceived biodiversity of fruit species for urban greenery in Indonesia: Case studies in Bogor, Jakarta, and Yogyakarta. Biodiversitas 23: 3166-3177. Urban greenery planning considering biodiversity scenarios is still rarely studied in Indonesia. This study aims to demonstrate edible fruit species (FS) as the scenario for urban greenery based on interviews with citizens in Indonesian cities. The study was carried out in the cities that have implemented smart city models i.e., Bogor, Jakarta, and Yogyakarta-Indonesia. Interviews were conducted in July-December 2019, involving 420 respondents. The results showed that 77.7% of all respondents agreed with the planting of FS as city greenery. In total for all cities, there were 79 species belonging to 32 families mentioned by the respondents consisting of 41 commercial and 38 underutilized FS. Each respondent was able to mention between 20.4 and 22.8 fruit species, irrespective of city. The ability to mention fruit species was affected by the respondent’s background, especially exposure during childhood to FS, frequency as a domestic tourist, mobility mode, and frequency of visiting city parks. The rationale for selecting FS was the benefit of fruit as a food source, followed by the benefit of ecology, economy, aesthetics, and health. Based on the significant cultural index, mango ranked first as the most preferred commercial fruit species, followed by rambutan, rose apple, orange, papaya, starfruit, guava, avocado, sapodilla, and longan; and for underutilized FS were shoe-button, pinang, nam nam, mulberry, cactus, canistel, cherry, and pear. Value of species richness, Shannon-Wienner, and Simpson diversity indices of FS within a city ranged 0.97 to 1.06, 3.62 to 3.83, and 0.97, respectively. Biodiversity scenarios could be useful information in the greenery planning of smart cities to coop with evolving broader environmental services."
Las características del espacio urbano como factores de exposición al COVID-19 en Ciudad de México,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0fe96e90cc04dc66405db2dcc124352dee3c1bbe,Héctor Emanuel León Rojas; Andrés Emiliano Sierra Martínez; Francisco De Aguinaga Padilla,"El artículo muestra la interacción entre las desigualdades socioespaciales acumuladas históricamente y la dinámica espacial del riesgo de contagio de COVID-19 en Ciudad de México. El objetivo es analizar la relación en el espacio urbano entre la localización de algunos factores de exposición al virus, identificados en la bibliografía especializada (vinculados con el transporte, la vivienda y el empleo) y la dinámica espacial de los contagios. Con métodos de análisis espacial, se vinculan conceptos de la ecología política y la teoría de la construcción social del riesgo. Se concluye que las condiciones de habitabilidad, el tiempo de traslado en medios de transporte colectivo y los niveles de desarrollo social son factores que determinan el comportamiento espacial de los contagios. Las periferias urbanas marginadas constituyen sitios desfavorecidos, en cuanto a las condiciones de exposición. 
Abstract 
The article shows the interaction between historically accumulated socio-spatial inequalities and the spatial dynamic of the risk of contagion of COVID-19 in Mexico City. The objective is to analyze the urban spatial relationship between the location of exposure factors to the virus, identified through literature review (associated with transport, living and employment), and the spatial dynamic of contagion. By using spatial analysis methods and techniques, concepts from political ecology and the theory of social construction of risk are connected. It is concluded that the conditions of habitability, the commuting time in public transportation and the levels of social development are determining factors of the spatial behaviour of contagion. Due to conditions of exposure, marginalized urban peripheries become disadvantaged places."
"Vulnerability Assessment of Resource-based Cities Based on Entropy Weight-topsis Model: A Case Study of Karamay, Xinjiang, China",2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0feb0630d790a7efe809d73a2ec555711adfb3e5,Xiaoyu Ju; Juhao Liu; Xiaodong Zhao,"
 The vulnerability of a city is an important index to evaluate the healthy development of a city, and also an important guide to the harmonious and sustainable development of resource-based cities. This paper constructs the vulnerability assessment system of resource-based cities from four dimensions of resources, ecology, society and economy, and puts forward the Entropy Weight-TOPSIS model to study the dynamic changes of urban vulnerability in the resource-based city—Karamay. The research results show that the urban vulnerability score of Karamay rose steadily from 2008 to 2017, but the overall vulnerability score was always between 0.1 and 0.2, indicating that the urban vulnerability of Karamay has not significantly improved and is still in the stage of extremely fragile economic and social comprehensive development. The ecological vulnerability, social vulnerability and economic vulnerability of Karamay show a good trend of improvement, and social development contributes the most to the comprehensive vulnerability of the city, while the score of resource vulnerability shows a significant decline. Resource development and utilization is still the key to determine the healthy and sustainable development of Karamay."

Hammelman; Elizabeth Shoffner; M. Cruzat; Samantha Lee,"Rosario, Argentina, a city of more than one million people strategically located on the Paraná River in the heart of a fertile agricultural region, is home to a significant industrial corridor where ongoing urbanization for industry, including that associated with the port complex and agroexport industries, vies for real estate space with peri-urban and urban farming production. The city is also the site of thriving municipal programs seeking to change food production and consumption outcomes through urban and peri-urban agriculture projects rooted in agroecology. This paper identifies the socio-natures critical for the formation and endurance of these agroecology assemblages. Based on interviews with 30 stakeholders in government, civil society, and agricultural production, we describe the integrated approach to environmental, social, and economic sustainability embedded in Rosario’s institutional agroecology programs. In particular, we discuss the actors and strategies (which seek to preserve land for agricultural uses), discursive renderings of socio-natures (as valuable biodiverse territories and productive diverse bodies), and the marketing of agroecological materialities (through production for public markets) that form and are formed by these assemblages. We also discuss the power dynamics embedded in sustaining urban and peri-urban agroecological projects through institutional means. This research contributes to literature on agroecology, urban agriculture, and the urban metabolism through providing empirical examples of socio-natural entanglements in urban agroecological assemblages."
Urban Political Ecology in Action: Community-Based Planning for Sustainability and Heritage in a High-Density Urban Landscape,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/100a07745961d240921e8bcd87aedf357595423e,Edward Chung Yim Yiu,"This paper shows a case study on a novel community-based sustainability planning framework that balances environmental, social, cultural dimensions for a high-density urban setting. The case study presents a community-driven “Four-Zero” sustainability model—zero energy, zero water, zero food, and zero waste—as a foundation for environmental sustainability practices implemented in a high-density estate in Hong Kong, alongside community-led ecological and heritage initiatives that reinforce place-based resilience. Through integrated activities, such as community farming, aquaponics, organic waste composting, biodiversity monitoring, and heritage mapping, the residents co-produced knowledge and activated novel bottom–up planning schemes and fostered social cohesion while advancing environmental objectives. Notably, the discovery of rare species and historic Dairy Farm remnants catalyzed a community-led planning proposal for an eco-heritage park that stimulated policy dialogues on conservation. These collective efforts illustrate how circular resource systems and cultural and ecological conservation can be balanced with urban development needs in compact, high-density communities. This case offers policy insights for rethinking urban sustainability planning in dense city contexts, contributing to global discourses on urban political ecology by examining socio–nature entanglements in contested urban spaces, to environmental justice by foregrounding community agency in shaping ecological futures, and to commoning practices through shared stewardship of urban resources."
Creative writing as nourishment: The political philosophy of Corine Pelluchon applied to our field,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/101d31e73833d45f9adc86284d7727f060b2fa85,J. V. Loon,": What if we thought of the creative writing discipline as part of a sustainable and sustaining urban or cosmo-political ecology that includes but is not limited to the university sector and the book industry? And what if we thought of creative writing practice and its resultant contribution (to knowledge, to arts practice, to the public good) as a means for sustaining an ethics of life? In this article, I draw on the work of political philosopher Corine Pelluchon, and in particular her recent work Nourishment: A Philosophy of the Political Body (2019), and apply her thinking to the kind of practice I (we) do on a daily basis. On the basis of a phenomenology of food and nourishment, Pelluchon’s thinking shows us how freedom depends on the “love of life” and on sharing what nourishes others. She applies her thinking to political systems, reimagining them such that their core aim comes to sustain an ethics of life that is relevant to multiple lifeforms and that takes into account past, present and future generations. Her project is underpinned by her affirmative ethics, her insistence on “love of life” as a crucial consideration. Inspired by her applied philosophy, I wonder about the shifts in thinking that may arise if we consider the creative writing discipline through the lens of her phenomenology of nourishment. Pelluchon argues that “we are bound to others through our relationship to nourishment” and that relationship is “above all a relation of enjoyment” (p. 11). What if we consider creative writers as integral to fashioning and maintaining “the milieu from which we live today” (p. 13). On whom (or what), then, does the creative writer interdepend for nourishment, and how might a foregrounding of such interdependence shape and reshape an ethics of creative writing practice?"
THE ESSENCE AND PROBLEMS OF DEFINING THE TERM «RURAL TERRITORY»,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10208b6bfc19f29e45de4d43d9e42260a90e1b60,М. Мykhidenko,"This article is devoted not to urbanized territories, but to rural territories. It turned out that when considering this term, there is a need for an in-depth study of the origins of the formation of the concept of ""village"". Historically, a village is both a diversity of resources and a place of production capacities and agricultural products. The village has always been a mirror of the spirituality of peoples, traditions and reflected its national exclusivity. The village is rich in natural biodiversity and cultural heritage. All this requires the need to study, develop and improve rural territories. But it turned out that in the Ukrainian legislation the concept of ""rural territories"" is not officially approved. The term is used in state acts, but its definition in the legal field is not officially. This concept has been studied by many scientists in different fields of scientific activity. The term ""rural territories"" is used in various concepts and development strategies, for example: ""Draft Strategy for the Development of Agriculture and Rural Territories of Ukraine for the Period up to 2030""; in the legal field; in political slogans, etc. The term ""rural territories"" is used, but unfortunately, it has not yet been officially enshrined in law. And this has led to many problems, such as: confusion in the theoretical aspect, corruption schemes at the practical level, incorrect interpretation in regulatory documents, and with all this, the failure to allocate funds due to the uncertainty of the object, which leads to the decline of rural areas.
But there is a fact of population migration from urbanized cities to the hinterland (villages, suburban areas, etc.). This is explained by poor ecology, the inadequate condition of Ukrainian cities, the development of viruses (Covid, hepatitis, etc.) in cities with a population of over a million, and military actions. Therefore, the article discusses some of the positive aspects of living in rural areas, and also studies the problems that a modern resident may face.
Domestic and foreign researchers helped to understand the question of what ""rural territories"" are and what characterizes them. The article provides an interdisciplinary analysis of the definition of rural areas from different scientific points of view. There are many definitions in different countries. They vary depending on the economic, social, demographic and political characteristics of the states.
In the article, we also gave our individual definition of the term ""rural territories "" from the point of view of a new look at town planning science. We consider it important to pay special attention to the development of rural areas in the urban development aspect.
This study can help the Ukrainian Legislation and regulatory framework to achieve success in the tasks set on the topic of regional development. And it can also become a good foundation for subsequent scientific works."
Urban Neoshamanism: Updating the Sacred Jurema in Northeast Brazil,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/103249e8ebbe3709978915295aef2c8bd2a28970,R. D. Santos; J. Marques,"Contemporary urban life has shown an increasing discomfort to individuals who have been experiencing almost epidemic symptoms of stress, depression and persistent melancholy as a result of experiences increasingly removed from a satisfactory and comfortable human sense. We study here the involvement of two individuals from quite different origins involved in the search for this meaning and who found in neoshamanism a way of returning to Nature and fullness, still inserted in the urban social life to which they belong. Although of Italian origin, Garone comes to Brazil and from revelations given by the jurema itself as an entity, he receives a call for the creation of his own neoshamanic line, associating techniques experienced in several countries with his own experience of these revelations. He was responsible for the establishment of four more groups here in Brazil and another one in Italy. Nilma is a Brazilian descendant of the Anambés, people from a traditional indigenous community in Pará. Her original group did not have a tradition of using power plants. Biologist with a postgraduate degree in Human Ecology also found in the neoshamanic use of Jurema, the rescue of his identity and ancestral reconnection. Their reunion was motivated by the anthropological studies of their academic formation. Both find in the northeastern origin of this sacrament an identification that brings them to their coexistence, and both start to take up residence in the region.The two cases addressed demonstrate the need for a new meaning of religiosity in the urban environment, which can be catalyzed by the use of power plants, if necessary modified for uses in adapted environments, even if they are far from their ancestral origin. Both have in the Santo Daime Doctrine a gateway established to access a ritualistic way that allowed the development of two different lines of neoshamanism based on the use of Jurema. Both adapt to their own environment a different manifestation, revealed by the ritual itself for each one. Keywords— Neoxamanism, Jurema, Urban, Power plants."
Robust Single-Image Tree Diameter Estimation with Mobile Phones,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10449c105004f17426e93a9d19564e4351509288,Amelia Holcomb; Linzhe Tong; Srinivasan Keshav,"Ground-based forest inventories are reliable methods for forest carbon monitoring, reporting, and verification schemes and the cornerstone of forest ecology research. Recent work using LiDAR-equipped mobile phones to automate parts of the forest inventory process assumes that tree trunks are well-spaced and visually unoccluded, or else require manual intervention or offline processing to identify and measure tree trunks. In this paper, we designed an algorithm that exploits a low-cost smartphone LiDAR sensor to estimate the trunk diameter automatically from a single image in complex and realistic field conditions. We implemented our design and built it into an app on a Huawei P30 Pro smartphone, demonstrating that the algorithm has low enough computational costs to run on this commodity platform in near real-time. We evaluated our app in 3 different forests across 3 seasons and found that in a corpus of 97 sample tree images, our app estimated the trunk diameter with a RMSE of 3.7 cm (R2 = 0.97; 8.0% mean absolute error) compared to manual DBH measurement. It achieved a 100% tree detection rate while reducing the surveyor time by up to a factor of 4.6. Our work contributes to the search for a low-cost, low-expertise alternative to terrestrial laser scanning that is nonetheless robust and efficient enough to compete with manual methods. We highlight the challenges that low-end mobile depth scanners face in occluded conditions and offer a lightweight, fully automatic approach for segmenting depth images and estimating the trunk diameter despite these challenges. Our approach lowers the barriers to in situ forest measurements outside of an urban or plantation context, maintaining a tree detection and accuracy rate comparable to previous mobile phone methods even in complex forest conditions."
Ecological consequences of urbanization on a legume-rhizobia mutualism,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10546e3c3c5e701964d5133c90e7a5cb2d6f002b,David Murray‐Stoker; Marc T. J. Johnson,"Mutualisms are key determinants of community assembly and composition, but urbanization can alter the dynamics of these interactions and associated effects on ecosystem functions. Legume-rhizobia mutualisms are a model interaction to evaluate the ecological and ecosystem-level effects of urbanization, particularly urban-driven eutrophication and nitrogen (N) deposition. Here, we evaluated how urbanization affected the ecology of the mutualism between white clover (Trifolium repens) and its rhizobial symbiont (Rhizobium leguminosarum symbiovar trifolii) along an urbanization gradient. We found that the abundance of rhizobium nodules on white clover decreased with urbanization. White clover acquired N from mixed sources of N fixation and uptake from the soil for the majority of the urbanization gradient, but white clover primarily acquired N from the soil rather than N fixation by rhizobia at the urban and rural limits of the gradient. Importantly, we identified soil N as a critical nexus for urban-driven changes in the white clover-rhizobium mutualism. Taken together, our results demonstrate that urbanization alters the ecological consequences of a legume-rhizobium mutualism, with direct and indirect effects of the urban landscape on an ecologically-important mutualistic interaction."

A Walk on the Wild Side: Steps towards an ecological arts pedagogy,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1072fb70cebf1666da63f8646b1af1e35bd39757,D. Haley,"

between home and school
walking a way to learning
life through the city.
(David Haley)


This article takes the reader for a stroll through a programme of ecological arts-led, performance-based research. The style is more poetic than scientific, although much ecological science is embedded within the art form. Indeed, Charles Darwin was known for his regular walks, as time and space for his reflections on evolution and his grandfather Erasmus Darwin was noted for the poetic form of his scientific treatises. Here also, the author breaks with academic convention to engage with walking and research as creative activities to deal with ecological issues. Of course, other artists like Richard Long and Hamish Fulton have walked as part of their practice, and there are a growing number of artists who consider walking as practice-as-research. In this article, the focus is specifically on walking as a creative form of inquiry, through community participation within urban contexts to create a critical dialogue focused on ecology in action."
What can we learn from wildlife sightings during the COVID‐19 global shutdown?,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/107c83e58255c7c237e1cbec547cb776c41b9746,A. Zellmer; Eric M. Wood; Thilina D. Surasinghe; Breanna J. Putman; Gregory B. Pauly; S. Magle; Jesse S. Lewis; Cria A. M. Kay; M. Fidino,"Abstract During the worldwide shutdown in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic, many reports emerged of urban wildlife sightings. While these images garnered public interest and declarations of wildlife reclaiming cities, it is unclear whether wildlife truly reoccupied urban areas or whether there were simply increased detections of urban wildlife during this time. Here, we detail key questions and needs for monitoring wildlife during the COVID‐19 shutdown and then link these with future needs and actions with the intent of improving conservation within urban ecosystems. We discuss the tools ecologists and conservation scientists can use to safely and effectively study urban wildlife during the shutdown. With a coordinated, multicity effort, researchers and community scientists can rigorously investigate the responses of wildlife to changes in human activities, which can help us address long‐standing questions in urban ecology, inspire conservation of wildlife, and inform the design of sustainable cities."
Unveiling the complex networks of urban tree diversity research: A global perspective,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1082e66547694225955123ce291ea195071b1088,Chunping Xie; Shuifei Chen; Dawei Liu; C. Jim,"Abstract Ecosystem services offered by urban forests must be proactively managed to remain diverse and sustainable. Recent research findings deserve a systematic synthesis to elucidate inherent knowledge structures and dynamics. This study focused on the urban tree diversity theme from 2000 to 2022. Web of Science Core Collection database provided bibliometric details on academic publications. The data‐driven quantitative analysis explored research quantities, emphasis, trends, patterns, linkages, and impacts by countries, institutions, authors, journals, and citations. Publications and research topics have expanded continually, with accelerated growth in recent years. Research activities, outputs and interactions demonstrated conspicuous spatial clustering. A few countries, institutions and researchers generated a notable proportion of publications. Their scholarly contributions were visualized in knowledge graphs as complex networks of nodes and inter‐node links. Keyword analysis generated a network to indicate research hotspots and frontiers to steer and prioritize future studies. Recent findings affirmed that cities can harbor substantial tree diversity due to enhanced habitat heterogeneity and successful species adaptation. Aligning tree traits with environmental conditions and management objectives can improve benefits. Urbanization can filter tree traits to shape community assemblages through stressors: habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss, in conjunction with pollution, climate change, and introduced species. Diversity preservation strategies include protecting remnant natural vegetation, connecting green spaces, and restoring complex canopy geometry and biomass structure. The emerging frontiers are marked by modeling future species distributions, leveraging technologies like remote sensing, linking ecology with human values, and committing to community‐based stewardship. Management can be upgraded by interdisciplinary perspectives integrating ecological science and social engagement. The findings highlight the need for biodiversity enrichment anchored by native species, trait‐matched assemblages, adaptive policies, and community participation to create livable‐green cities. This review synthesizes key advances in urban tree ecology and biodiversity research to inform the planning and stewardship of resilient urban forests."

Tryputen; Kuznetsov Vitaliy; Petrenko Vitaliy; V. Artemchuk; V. Andriichuk,"The article discusses the issues of models, tools and approaches to the smart cities subject area, which served as the basis for the standardization of the smart cities concept. Familiarity with these issues allows assess and understand the state of science in this field, which covers various aspects of the design, organization and operation of a smart city. As a result, the article gives presentation of different approach to smart cities creation. The authors urge to study in more detail certain aspects of the smart cities information technologies: digital economy, urban operating system, green energy, standards for transport movement, urban ecology. The article noted that today analysts are still discussing many proposed models and possible ways of transition to Smart City. The role of the Internet platforms in Smart Cities and various approaches to the implementation of the Smart City platforms themselves are shown. The paper compares various international approaches for smart cities creation and suggests that using project management methodologies is the best way for that goal. Project management allows maintain a balance between the total control of urban infrastructure and the right of residents for privacy. Meanwhile, many of us already live in a world of automated systems that manage urban infrastructure. The study emphasized ready-made information solutions exist that analyze large amounts of data using analytical forecasts and machine learning algorithms. In conclusion, it is noted that the main goal is that the introduction of the concept of smart cities should become a tool for the sustainable development of humankind while preserving the possibilities of freedom of choice and the inviolability of private life for a person, not transfer these functions to artificial intelligence."
Renewable Energy Sources and Other Basic Components of Increasing Energy Efficiency and Energy Independence,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10b2650e6bf29880fec6f7fe14081d83d278e5ee,Serhii Kravtsov; R. Zhesan; O. Holyk,"The article examines the current state of state policy in the field of energy saving and energy efficiency, prospects for further implementation of energy-saving technologies, taking into account national and world experience. Attention is focused on the fact that renewable energy sources can be considered as basic elements of energy efficiency of separate sectors of the economy and energy independence of the state as a whole. This is facilitated by the constant growth of humanity's energy needs, the lack of fossil fuel and energy resources, their depletion, as well as the introduction of modern trends in the development of industries. The state policy of Ukraine for the coming years, enshrined in a number of legislative and regulatory acts, envisages comprehensive support and development of the sphere of energy conservation, reduction of harmful anthropogenic impact on ecology, reduction of energy intensity of products. Ukraine has significant potential for energy saving and is gradually increasing efforts to improve the energy efficiency of separate industry of the economy and the energy independence of the state as a whole. In particular, in the field of architecture and urban planning, measures to increase the energy efficiency of buildings and constructions, through the use of renewable energy sources and the creation and implementation of modern automatic control systems for engineering subsystems in general life support systems, seem quite promising. In order to inherit the considerable previous scientific experience, the latest research and publications on this topic were analyzed. Prospective renewable energy sources, methods for determining their energy potential, regions and methods of practical use in the field of increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and constructions, as well as options for improving existing and creating new modern automatic control systems have been identified. Ways of further scientific research are planned."
Nocturnal city lighting elicits a macroscale response from an insect outbreak population,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10b3f554eacdb09da0ed492f74d8660962ae1665,Elske K. Tielens; Paula Cimprich; Bonne A. Clark; Alisha M. DiPilla; J. Kelly; D. Mirković; Alva I. Strand; Mengyuan Zhai; P. M. Stepanian,"Anthropogenic environmental change affects organisms by exposing them to enhanced sensory stimuli that can elicit novel behavioural responses. A pervasive feature of the built environment is artificial nocturnal lighting, and brightly lit urban areas can influence organism abundance, distribution and community structure within proximate landscapes. In some cases, the attractive or disorienting effect of artificial light at night can draw animals into highly unfavourable habitats, acting as a macroscale attractive ecological sink. Despite their significance for animal ecology, identifying cases of these phenomena and determining their effective scales and the number of organisms impacted remains challenging. Using an integrated set of remote-sensing observations, we quantify the effect of a large-scale attractive sink on nocturnal flights of an outbreak insect population in Las Vegas, USA. At the peak of the outbreak, over 45 million grasshoppers took flight across the region, with the greatest numbers concentrating over high-intensity city lighting. Patterns of dusk ascent from vegetated habitat toward urban areas suggest a daily pull toward a time-varying nocturnal attractive sink. The strength of this attractor varies with grasshopper density. These observations provide the first macroscale characterization of the effects of nocturnal urban lighting on the behaviour of regional insect populations and demonstrate the link between insect perception of the built environment and resulting changes in spatial and movement ecology. As human-induced environmental change continues to affect insect populations, understanding the impacts of nocturnal light on insect behaviour and fitness will be vital to developing robust large-scale management and conservation strategies."
"Editorial: Social-ecological urbanism: Developing discourse, institutions and urban form for the design of resilient social-ecological systems in cities",2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10b749b8dd7a393995310222a02e9a34d0e8ae59,Meta Berghauser Pont; Stephan Barthel; J. Colding; Åsa Gren; Ann Legeby; L. Marcus,"The concept Social-Ecological Urbanism (SEU) was launched by the publication of the book Principles for Social-Ecological Urbanism in 2013 (Barthel et al., 2013). SEU is increasingly used by researchers to improve resilience in the urban built environment. The approach is positioned at the interface of urban ecology and urban design (Marcus and Colding, 2014; Colding et al., 2022). It points out how resilience in interlinked social and ecological urban systems can be addressed through informed design of institutions and urban form, both shaped by urban discourse. A key tenet is that a deeper understanding of how discourse, institutions and urban form connect to selforganising urban systems, can help create the conditions for social-ecological outcomes in accordance with political goals and aims on sustainability. SEU offers a far broader conception of urban sustainability than current discourses, by addressing cities on the relevant systems level, where, moreover, social, economic and ecological urban systems are combined. Humans become co-creators of nature in SEU through the integration and management of ecosystem services. SEU integrates and aligns ecological and social services in various urban design projects and adopts social–ecological resilience thinking as a guiding design principle. OPEN ACCESS"
"Coupling Study of Urban Ecological Planning and Environmental Music in Hefei University Town, China",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10d6ff34757f92f4fc02b13afb6733559d9a8be9,Su Wang; Huaidong He; Qingqing Xiao,"Urban ecological planning uses ecology, environmental science, economics, and urbanology to adjust and transform various complex urban relationships, seeking to expand benefits and reducing risks. Environmental music, a kind of non appreciative music, can act on subject consciousness and may influence the urban ecosystem in which it is employed. Many connections appear between urban ecological planning and environmental music. This study took the university town of Hefei City, Anhui Province, China, as an example. This work was conducted to explore the effects of environmental music on the development of urban ecological planning by combining relevant studies of environmental science, urban ecology, urban planning, and musicology. The results showed that environmental music, as a cultural information flow, affected the urban ecosystem and had a typical function for different ecological function zones in the city. Different types of environmental music had spiritual and cultural publicity functions in regulating the main body of the urban ecosystem (residents and students), and it also influenced the growth of common plants in cities and had different ecological and environmental effects."
Trees and people determine the feeding activity of a migratory bird in an urban mega-park of Mexico city,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10e2bcf3adeffca3f2e139d14091becb61b64212,Rubén Ortega‐Álvarez; Rafael Calderón-Parra; Fernando García-Luna,"Feeding research is relevant to comprehend wildlife use of urban systems and to guide management practices. Coupling foraging with habitat assessments is important because environmental conditions affect animal access to food, leading to variations in behaviours and the numbers of feeding individuals. Still, we have little comprehension about the foraging ecology of animals in Neotropical cities. We analyzed the feeding use of an urban mega-park by a migratory bird in Mexico City, central Mexico. We used distance sampling and hierarchical models to identify the habitat traits that determined the feeding density of the Yellow-rumped (Audubon’s) Warbler (Setophaga coronata auduboni) in the Chapultepec mega-park. Moreover, we evaluated the spatial variation of the feeding behavior of the species across the site and compared the substrates that this warbler used for foraging by utilizing a Bayesian modelling approach. We included observations from a grey area adjacent to the mega-park for comparison purposes. Our results demonstrated that the number of feeding individuals of the Yellow-rumped Warbler was determined by tree species richness and the number of pedestrians. Greater numbers of tree species might foster the diversity and availability of food resources for the warbler, whereas the number of pedestrians might increase risk perception by birds, reducing their foraging activity. The variation in the proportion of feeding occasions among the sections of Chapultepec supported the pattern associated with our feeding density analysis. The species fed most frequently on trees than in any other substrate. Thus, we showed that urban green areas provide important feeding grounds for the Yellow-rumped Warbler during the migratory period, particularly where tree species richness increases and human activity reduces. Management and restoration activities across the mega-park should be directed to foster tree species richness and mitigate the impact of human activities to enhance the feeding activity of migratory birds."
Ecosystem Services Assessment Tools for Regenerative Urban Design in Oceania,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10e385001c146d2ba39359f39fff0415fd1a91d8,Fabian Delpy; M. Pedersen Zari; B. Jackson; R. Benavidez; T. Westend,"Tools that spatially model ecosystem services offer opportunities to integrate ecology into regenerative urban design. However, few of these tools are designed for assessing ecosystem services in cities, meaning their application by designers is potentially limited. This research reviews and compares a range of ecosystem services assessment tools to find those that are most suited for the urban context of Oceania. The tool classification includes considerations of type of input and output data, time commitment, and necessary skills required. The strengths and limitations of the most relevant tools are further discussed alongside illustrative case studies, some collected from literature and one conducted as part of this research in Wellington, Aotearoa using the Land Utilisation and Capability Indicator (LUCI) tool. A major finding of the research is that from the 95 tools reviewed, only four are judged to be potentially relevant for urban design projects. These are modelling tools that allow spatially explicit visualisation of biophysical quantification of ecosystem services. The ecosystem services assessed vary among tools and the outputs’ reliability is often highly influenced by the user’s technical expertise. The provided recommendations support urban designers and architects to choose the tool that best suits their regenerative design project requirements."

This paper aimed to provide input on the sustainable development of the Fort Nieuw Victoria area. Using qualitative methods through a descriptive approach is expected to answer the problems and reaching the purpose of this paper. The results of this study show that by using the triple bottom line concept, in the sustainable development at Fort Nieuw Victoria it’s not only as tourist destination to increase local revenue (economic side), but also make it a green open space as a provider of oxygen for urban communities (ecology), and can be used as a space of education, recreation, a gathering place for young people (social side)"

From city center to suburbs: Developing a timeline-based TOD assessment model to explore the dynamic changes in station areas of Tokyo metropolitan area,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10fdffcf2dc6f21e0d575b715ae1ad420417ff98,Weiyao Yang; Wanglin Yan; Lihua Chen; Haopeng Li,"Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) is regarded as a planning concept for urban sustainable development that has been increasingly embraced worldwide in recent years. However, scholars rarely assess the sustainability of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) station areas over a period of time. This study, building upon the existing TOD assessment model based on node-place-ecology, introduces the concepts of “low-carbon cities” and a “timeline-based.” Focuses on whether the three dimensions of TOD station areas—node, place, and carbon—are dynamically balanced over time towards sustainable development. More specifically, this study starting from a micro-level perspective, takes the 70 stations on the Odakyu line as a clue, a railway that spans Tokyo and Kanagawa, aiming to develop a quantitative assessment model for sustainable TOD based on node-place-carbon, and to summarize the spatial dynamic changes of the 70 station areas in the Tokyo metropolitan area from 2011 to 2019 through the principles of sustainable development line (SDL) and K-means cluster analysis. The results indicate that after 8 years, the overall development of the station areas is moving towards sustainability, but there are still some station areas that deviate to some extent. And also, we observed that the trend of monopolization in the central station areas of the Tokyo metropolitan area is continuously strengthening. We believe that the sustainable assessment model developed in this study can provide constructive reference for the planning and design of cities, especially metropolitan areas, around the world."
Greening and Browning Trends on the Pacific Slope of Peru and Northern Chile,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/110ad897746605a870e1442ed7f49ed24ad25fd1,H. Lepage; E. Barnes; Eleanor Kor; M. Hunter; C. Barnes,"Accurate detection and quantification of regional vegetation trends are essential for understanding the dynamics of landscape ecology and vegetation distribution. We applied a comprehensive trend analysis to satellite data to describe geospatial changes in vegetation along the Pacific slope of Peru and northern Chile, from sea level to the continental divide, a region characterised by biologically unique and highly sensitive arid and semi-arid environments. Our statistical analyses show broad regional patterns of positive trends in EVI, called “greening”, alongside patterns of “browning”, where trends are negative between 2000 and 2020. The coastal plain and foothills, up 1000 m, contain notable greening of the coastal Lomas and newly irrigated agricultural lands occurring alongside browning trends related to changes in land use practices and urban development. Strikingly, the precordilleras show a distinct ‘greening strip’, which extends from approximately 6°S to 22°S, with an altitudinal trend, ascending from the tropical lowlands (170–780 m) in northern Peru to the subtropics (1000–2800 m) in central Peru and temperate zone (2600–4300 m) in southern Peru and northern Chile. We find that the geographical characteristics of the greening strip do not match climate zones previously established by Köppen and Geiger. Greening and browning trends in the coastal deserts and the high Andes lie within well defined climatic and life zones, producing variable but identifiable trends. However, the distinct Pacific slope greening presents an unexpected distribution with respect to the regional Köppen–Geiger climate and life zones. This work provides insights on understanding the effects of climate change on Peru’s diverse ecosystems in highly sensitive, biologically unique arid and semi-arid environments on the Pacific slope."
An Investigation of Freshwater Turtle Trophic Ecology in New Mexico Using Stable Isotopes,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/111a851e166830a29721ac025c2da25602543c40,Jonathan Duran; Karin Ebey; Lisa N. Barrow,"Abstract Sympatric species are expected to differ in resource use in order to avoid competition, leading to niche partitioning in natural communities. Invasive species can disrupt community structure, but these impacts are often difficult to measure. In this study, we used stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen to investigate dietary niche partitioning of freshwater turtle assemblages at three sites in the Middle Rio Grande Basin of New Mexico. We sampled four turtle species common to the region, including Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta), Spiny Softshells (Apalone spinifera), Common Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina), and invasive Red-Eared Sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans). We found that species composition at the study site with the most anthropogenic influence, the Rio Grande Nature Center in the urban population center of Albuquerque, was dominated by invasive T. s. elegans, while study sites in more remote areas (Sevilleta and Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuges) primarily consisted of native species. Furthermore, we observed high overlap in niche space among turtle species at the Rio Grande Nature Center, but evidence consistent with niche partitioning at the other two sites. We found higher nitrogen levels in the more carnivorous A. spinifera and C. serpentina compared to other species. We also found evidence for an ontogenetic shift toward a less carnivorous diet in T. s. elegans. Our study provides valuable baseline information about understudied turtle assemblages within the Middle Rio Grande region and suggests there is potential for competition between invasive T. s. elegans and native turtle species in New Mexico."
The effect of camera-trap viewshed obstruction on wildlife detection: implications for inference,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/112449f034af2aa60500f95f4905b3e5f46b4d4f,R. Moll; Waldemar Ortiz-Calo; Jonathon D. Cepek; P. D. Lorch; P. Dennis; T. Robison; R. Montgomery,"Abstract Context Camera traps are one of the most popular tools used to study wildlife worldwide. Numerous recent studies have evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of camera traps as a research tool. Nonetheless, important aspects of camera-trap methodology remain in need of critical investigation. One such issue relates to camera-trap viewshed visibility, which is often compromised in the field by physical obstructions (e.g. trees) or topography (e.g. steep slopes). The loss of visibility due to these obstructions could affect wildlife detection rates, with associated implications for study inference and management application. Aims We aimed to determine the effect of camera-trap viewshed obstruction on wildlife detection rates for a suite of eight North American species that vary in terms of ecology, commonness and body size. Methods We deployed camera traps at 204 sites throughout an extensive semi-urban park system in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, from June to September 2016. At each site, we quantified camera-trap viewshed obstruction by using a cover-board design. We then modelled the effects of obstruction on wildlife detection rates for the eight focal species. Key results We found that detection rates significantly decreased with an increasing viewshed obstruction for five of the eight species, including both larger and smaller mammal species (white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, and squirrels, Sciurus sp., respectively). The number of detections per week per camera decreased two- to three-fold as visibility at a camera site decreased from completely free of obstruction to mostly obstructed. Conclusions These results imply that wildlife detection rates are influenced by site-level viewshed obstruction for a variety of species, and sometimes considerably so. Implications Researchers using camera traps should address the potential for this effect to ensure robust inference from wildlife image data. Accounting for viewshed obstruction is critical when interpreting detection rates as indices of abundance or habitat use because variation in detection rate could be an artefact of site-level viewshed obstruction rather than due to underlying ecological processes."

Fractal dimension of tree crowns explains species functional-trait responses to urban environments at different scales.,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11251a230bf69719f9f5391f879cb676b00557cc,G. Arseniou; D. MacFarlane,"The evolution of form and function of trees of diverse species has taken place over hundreds of millions of years, while urban environments are relatively new on an evolutionary time scale, representing a novel set of environmental constraints for trees to respond to. It is important to understand how trees of different species, planted in these anthropogenically-structured urban ecosystems, are responding to them. Many theories have been advanced to understand tree form and function, including several that suggest the fractal-like geometry of trees is a direct reflection of inherent and plastic morphological and physiological traits that govern tree growth and survival. In this research, we analyzed the 'fractal dimension' of thousands of tree crowns of many different tree species, growing in different urban environments across the USA, to learn more about the nature of trees and their responses to urban environments at different scales. Our results provide new insights regarding how tree crown fractal dimension relates to balances between hydraulic- and light capture-related functions (e.g., drought and shade tolerance). Our findings indicate that trees exhibit reduced crown fractal dimension primarily to reduce water loss in hotter cities. More specifically, the intrinsic drought tolerance of the studied species arises from lower surface to volume ratios at both whole-crown and leaf scales, pre-adapting them to drought-stress in urban ecosystems. Needle-leaved species showed a clear tradeoff between optimizing the fractal dimension of their crowns for drought versus shade tolerance. Broad-leaved species showed a fractal crown architecture that responded principally to inherent drought tolerance. Adjusting for the temperature of cities and intrinsic species effects, the fractal dimension of tree crowns was lower in more heavily urbanized areas (with greater paved area or buildings) and due to crowns conflicting with utility wires. With expectations for more urbanization and generally hotter future climates, worldwide, our results add new insights into the physiological ecology of trees in urban environments, which may help humans to provide more hospitable habitats for trees in urbanized areas and to make better decisions about tree selection in urban forest management."
The ideal meander: Exploring freshwater scientist drawings of river restoration,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/113733d56a9922f1c45523a0dfc214ee7c0ff70f,Kristen N. Wilson; S. Baker; G. Kondolf,"The aesthetic appeal of s-shaped curves in art and landscape design may help explain the prevalence of single-thread meandering channels in river restoration projects where the channel planform is reconfigured. In some restoration projects, the channel planform follows repeating symmetrical bends. To see if freshwater scientists would draw a similar restored planform, we asked scientists to illustrate a restored channel and observed what patterns emerged from the drawings. Most scientists depicted single-thread meanders for the restored channel form with some drawings including large wood in the channel, multi-thread channel forms, and wildlife and human elements. We consider possible explanations for why respondents depicted idealized meanders. We also describe drawings that did not depict the ideal meander but showcased a diversity of channel forms and restored river scenes. While recognizing the role of aesthetics in river restoration, especially in urban settings, designs can be expanded to include disorderly planform designs with non-symmetrical single-thread meanders and multi-threaded channels with forms inspired by local ecology, geomorphology, and social values."

The aim of this research is to explore and describe the care of environment ideology within subcultural communication in the framework of cultural studies using visual semiotic analysis of stencil graffiti within the urban space. It is done by exploring the key elements of subcultural communication as an artistic response to contemporary global and local challenges/ecological problems. By my research We hope to demonstrate the presence of the social critique potential of care of environment in the dialectical cultural semiosis (emerging and circulation of signs within society) between counter-culture and �the mainstream�.

Hanney,"Through the lens of ecologies of belonging, The City as Escape Room transfers a simple and commonly held understanding of the escape room into a metaphor that reveals a complex layering of place, participation, and affect in meaning-making for transmedia storytellers. It situates the city as a play space where community participation, meaning-making, and co-creation are interwoven as meaningful story experiences. By mirroring the practice of urban foraging, the discussion explores transmedia storytelling as a form of sympoiesis that brings into being a shared memory, a becoming-with the city for the community that resides within. Avoiding the common placemaking tropes associated with public sector marketing and economic (re)generation, city-wide transmedia storytelling is instead considered a form of speculative fabulation that can defamiliarize the familiar and generate affective story experiences. The offering of a case study that contrasts commercial and community-driven transmedia experiences further illuminates how immersive experience design can take hold of a city as a play space and render it as a meaningful story experience."
Ecologization Of Construction Activities: National and International Experience,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11d4cd5becf1927abc41447037db97a19722e251,Guzal Uzakova,". Today, in many countries of the world, along with the sharp demographic situation the level of urbanization is also increasing. The right of citizens to live is closely related to the provision of their right to land use, which is usually ensured in the process of land use within the administrative-territorial boundaries of states, where urban, rural and other types of settlements are located. The state of the environment in settlements is inextricably linked with the ecologization of the construction industry. For this reason, in this research work the issues of compliance with environmental requirements in the field of construction were studied in terms of urban planning and ecology. Thus, international legal documents, foreign experience and the national legislative base of the Republic of Uzbekistan were analyzed comparatively. The article also discusses the tasks of maintaining environmental quality in the construction industry, especially in the implementation of construction work in settlements. The author studied from a scientific and legal point of view the tasks of government agencies in the organization of green construction in urban, rural and other areas, public participation in governance, the benefits of developing a ""green"" economy, the introduction of low-waste technologies, as well as build an energy-efficient buildings and houses. This article also analyses scientific researches in the field of ecologization of the construction process. As a result of systematic studying the legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan in the field of construction, the author scientifically and theoretically systematized the procedures for the ecologization of this field. Also, considered prospects for harmonization of national urban planning norms and rules with international norms and standards. In addition, developed a scientific and theoretical basis for achieving following the objectives, like the introduction of environmentally friendly innovative technologies to achieve the strategic goals of the Concept of Environmental Protection of the Republic of Uzbekistan until 2030, prevention and reduction of negative impact on the environment, ensuring the growth of environmentally oriented economy, application of ""green"" standards in construction activities, increasing the volume of construction of certified buildings and structures in the system of voluntary environmental certification of real estate."
SYSTEMIC ECODRIVING APPROACHES TO REDUCE EMISSIONS IN URBAN CONDITIONS,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11d90bc32fd666d286f12d13698a53d78c5ed324,A. Dmytrychenko; Yuliia Artemchuk,"The study examines some of the programs and measures that can help reduce emissions of toxic substances from motor vehicles in cities by reducing fuel consumption. In particular, professional and careful driving helps reduce fuel consumption and wear and tear on equipment, and also ensures the safety of passenger and cargo transportation in urban conditions. It was determined that such a systematic approach in world practice is called ""Ecodriving"", or ecological driving, the use of which contributes to the sustainable development of settlements. The main impacts of Ecodriving on the external environment are considered and analyzed. Prospects for further research are presented, which consist in developing a methodology for applying Ecodriving in cities and creating a structured strategy of educational initiatives for enterprises and educational institutions in the transport industry.

Evaluation of Green Cities in the Drainage Area of China’s Beijing–Hangzhou Canal,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11f4bb5c8c454c52ee2cb347dc34db511d3fad3e,Fei Shi; Yuanyuan Lu; Fan Wu; Chengxiang Wang; W. Hsu,"The phrase ‘green cities’ refers to an idealised and modernised urban development model that features harmonious development among the environment, ecology, society, culture, and the inhabitants of a city. Harmonious humanistic relations and green pathways have become predominant models in modern urban development. Green city construction has drawn considerable attention. However, the construction and development of green cities involves numerous problems. The various needs of different populations must be coordinated to foster the green development of a city. In this study, the analytic hierarchy process was used to classify factors related to green city construction into different levels. The scope of the empirical verification was eight cities alongshore the drainage area of the Jiangsu section of the Beijing–Hangzhou Canal. Data from 2009, 2014, and 2019 were selected for analysis. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed using these data, and standards were established to serve as a reference for city administrators in the process of decision-making regarding green city construction."

Vance‐Chalcraft; Na’Taki Osborne Jelks,"Ecological changes are creating disruptions that often disproportionately impact communities of color and economically disadvantaged areas. Scientists who study the consequences experienced by these communities are uniquely suited to bring the public into their work as a way of setting conditions that enable impacted residents to empower themselves to advance environmental and community change. In addition to involving community stakeholders in the process of science, community science can be used to motivate learning and increase engagement of students. Here we highlight a case study of one way a historically Black college involved local communities and students in water quality monitoring efforts to examine the role of the environment in human health. Students in an introductory-level environmental toxicology course collaborated with community members to track pollution and monitor conditions in an urban, impaired stream. Students participated in bi-monthly water quality monitoring alongside community watershed researchers and an annual day-long multi-site sampling event with community residents and organizations. Through this engagement, students and community members contributed to the collection of data, learned about the significance of their results, and translated findings into strategies to advance watershed restoration, health, quality of life, and environmental justice goals.

Application of plant metabarcoding to identify diverse honeybee pollen forage along an urban–agricultural gradient,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12139924db67c21b8326494b5fcbe52ae1f53262,R. Richardson; T. Eaton; Chia-Hua Lin; Garrett Cherry; Reed M. Johnson; Douglas B. Sponsler,"Understanding animal foraging ecology requires large sample sizes spanning broad environmental and temporal gradients. For pollinators, this has been hampered by the laborious nature of morphologically identifying pollen. Identifying pollen from urban environments is particularly difficult due to the presence of diverse ornamental species associated with consumer horticulture. Metagenetic pollen analysis represents a potential solution to this issue. Building upon prior laboratory and bioinformatic methods, we applied quantitative multilocus metabarcoding to characterize the foraging ecology of honeybee colonies situated in urban, suburban, mixed suburban–agricultural and rural agricultural sites in central Ohio, USA. In cross‐validating a subset of our metabarcoding results using microscopic palynology, we find strong concordance between the molecular and microscopic methods. Our results suggest that forage from the agricultural site exhibited decreased taxonomic diversity and temporal turnover relative to the urban and suburban sites, though the generalization of this observation will require replication across additional sites and cities. Our work demonstrates the power of honeybees as environmental samplers of floral community composition at large spatial scales, aiding in the distinction of taxa characteristically associated with urban or agricultural land use from those distributed ubiquitously across the sampled landscapes. Observed patterns of high forage diversity and compositional turnover in our more urban sites are likely reflective of the fine‐grain heterogeneity and high beta diversity of urban floral landscapes at the scale of honeybee foraging. This provides guidance for future studies investigating how relationships between urbanization and measures of pollinator health are mediated by variation in floral resource dynamics across landscapes."

Scholars in the field of ecology and environment are aware of the necessity of urban rewilding and strive to restore the connection between human and wild nature in the city. Urban rewilding is a measure to restore the natural ecological process of the urban environment to protect urban biodiversity and enhance urban residents’ daily contact with wild nature. The discussion on the theoretical foundation for urban rewilding can provide theoretical reference for future urban greening construction and management. [Methods/process] This research introduces the background and connotation of urban rewilding, summarizes relevant basic theories of urban rewilding, and explains the connections between such theories. These theories include urban ecology, rewilding, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) and biophilia, landscape ecology, biodiversity, community assembly, community succession, self-design and designer approach, invasion ecology, landscape disturbance and resilience, exposure ecology, and landscape preference theories. In order to show the organic connections between the aforesaid theories, this research sorts out these theories from the perspectives of urban ecosystem and"
Author Correction: Closely related gull species show contrasting foraging strategies in an urban environment,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/122a3d51d16e51568c57317cf85e5330d872599f,K. Lato; D. Madigan; R. Veit; L. Thorne,"The expansion of urban landscapes has both negative and positive effects on wildlife. Understanding how different species respond to urbanization is key to assessing how urban landscapes influence regional wildlife behavior and ecosystem structure. Gulls are often described as strong urban adapters, but few studies have explored species-specific differences in habitat use. Here, we use GPS tracking in conjunction with stable isotope analysis (SIA) to quantify the habitat use and trophic ecology of great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus) and herring gulls (L. argentatus) in an urbanized area. Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) of foraging locations revealed significant differences in the habitat use between species. Great black-backed gulls foraged primarily in marine habitats and herring gulls foraged primarily in specific urban habitats (e.g., landfills, dumpsters) and showed higher site fidelity in terms of the proportion of foraging sites revisited. Further, great black-backed gulls had significantly higher δ15N and δ13C than herring gulls, reflecting the use of marine, rather than urban, food sources. This study highlights the variability in urban habitat utilization among closely related species, assesses stable isotope signatures of urban diets in wild birds, and discusses ecological implications of the relative contribution of urban and marine foraging."
Sustainable nature‐based solutions require establishment and maintenance of keystone plant‐pollinator interactions,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/123ca55d15fd9660002a7eb218224a56df8dbbec,Nicole E. Rafferty; Christopher T. Cosma,"Many nature‐based solutions (NBS), including urban greenspaces, urban agriculture and agroforestry, depend upon animal‐pollinated plants to sequester carbon or to provide other ecosystem services. Thus, long‐term success of these solutions also depends upon resilient pollinator communities. Despite their importance to functioning communities, a literature search revealed that 0%–3% of papers on NBS and related topics considered pollinators or pollination. Pollinators were more likely to be considered in the subgroup of papers on NBS related to agricultural production, where 12.5% considered pollination. Conservation of species interactions is essential to conservation of biodiversity and the sustained benefits of NBS. By applying our understanding of the ecology of plant‐pollinator mutualisms to the implementation of NBS, we can promote their functioning under future climatic conditions. In particular, we point to the need to identify keystone plants and pollinators, those species that contribute most to biodiversity maintenance, community stability and ecosystem function, and to leverage these species and their interactions in NBS and conservation efforts. We further advocate for the use of phylogenetic trait‐based analyses to understand the characteristics associated with keystoneness. Synthesis: Resilience of pollination services rests upon the responses of keystone species and their partners, and the likelihood that they continue to express traits that confer mutual benefit under future climates. By understanding the traits of species of outsized importance to their communities, we gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the resilience of pollination services and the NBS that rely on those services in a changing world."

Calamaro; Y. Beck; Ran Ben Melech; D. Shmilovitz,"Energy fraud detection bears significantly on urban ecology. Reduced losses and power consumption would affect carbon dioxide emissions and reduce thermal pollution. Fraud detection also provides another layer of urban socio-economic correlation heatmapping and improves city energy distribution. This paper describes a novel algorithm of energy fraud detection, utilizing energy and energy consumption specialized knowledge poured into AI front-end. The proposed algorithm improves fraud detection’s accuracy and reduces the false positive rate, as well as reducing the preliminary required training dataset. The paper also introduces a holistic algorithm, specifying the major phenomena that disguises as energy fraud or affects it. Consequently, a mathematical foundation for energy fraud detection for the proposed algorithm is presented. The results show that a unique pattern is obtained during fraud, which is independent of a reference non-fraud pattern of the same customer. The theory is implemented on real data taken from smart metering systems and validated in real life scenarios."
Impact of underground storm drain systems on larval ecology of Culex and Aedes species in urban environments of Southern California,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1242eb16002cc32b350696a6da2ee9a640394444,Xiaoming Wang; Guofa Zhou; Daibin Zhong; Yiji Li; Stacia Octaviani; Andrew T Shin; Timothy W. Morgan; Kiet Nguyen; Jessica Bastear; Melissa A Doyle; R. Cummings; G. Yan,"An extensive network of storm water conveyance systems in urban areas, often referred to as the “underground storm drain system” (USDS), serves as significant production habitats for mosquitoes. Knowledge of whether USDS habitats are suitable for newly introduced dengue vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus will help guide surveillance and control efforts. To determine whether the USDS functions as a suitable larval habitat for Culex, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in southern California, we examined mosquito habitat utilization and larval survivorship using laboratory microcosm studies. The data showed that USDS constituted 4.1% of sampled larval habitats for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, and 22.0% for Cx. quinquefasciatus. Furthermore, USDS water collected in the summer completely inhibited Aedes larval development, but yielded a 15.0% pupation rate for Cx. quinquefasciatus. Food supplementation in the microcosms suggests that nutrient deficiency, toxins and other factors in the USDS water led to low success or complete failure of larval development. These results suggest that USDS habitats are currently not major productive larval habitats for Aedes mosquitoes in southern California. Our findings prompt inclusion of assessments of pupal productivity in USDS habitats and adult mosquito resting sites in the mosquito surveillance program."
The Wasp as a Terrestrial Indicator of Environmental Metal Composition: Evidence from Zimbabwe,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1250502dd73b3e6370a5a979bcc3f1ddaaf9d6be,Yasfir Tarif Nadat; H. Kylin; R. Sithole; Velesia Lesch; H. Bouwman,"We explored metal concentrations in wasps from 4 sites near Harare, Zimbabwe, on a 106 km west–east transect. We found elevated concentrations at 2 presumed‐polluted sites (a platinum [Pt] mine and a known polluted lake) located near a metal‐enriched geological feature (the Great Dyke). A site in urban Harare and a nature reserve served as reference. Only wasps from the 2 presumed‐polluted sites had quantifiable Pt. For Cr, Ni, Mg, Se, Fe, Mn, and V, we report the highest concentrations in wasps yet published. Wasps from the presumed‐polluted sites had significantly higher concentrations of most metals when compared with wasps from the reference sites, suggesting pollution as a source. Geology, however, differs between the sites. It is probable, therefore, that both geology and pollution contributed to the differences in metal concentrations. Because of its long and narrow dimensions (550 km long and 4–11 km wide), the Great Dyke offers opportunities for comparative studies. Because wasps form a complex part of the food web and ecology, studies on the transfer of metals to wasps' predators are needed, especially given that some birds specialize in feeding on hymenopterans. The rich diversity of wasps (>145 000 species worldwide) occupying multiple different trophic levels is a good indicator, and wasps have a rich potential to join other invertebrates as terrestrial indicators.

For this reason, a management strategy is needed as part of an effort to improve the landscape services of Depok City.  This study aims to analyze the characteristics of home gardens and the potential for developing stingless bee-friendly home gardens to support the optimization of urban landscape services. The research was conducted using a field survey on sample of home gardens selected through purposive sampling methods, interviews, questionnaires, and literature studies. Based on the conditions of climate, weather, ecology, 90 samples of home gardens and respondents, Depok City has the potential to develop the concept of a honey bee-friendly home garden. These conditions can support the activity of stingless bees and provide a source of available food throughout the year. The concept of a stingless bee-friendly home garden can be achieved by presenting a diversity of food plant sources, providing bee hives, and proper home garden management. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct socialization and training on stingless-bee keeping in the yard starting from farmers group, making an example of a honey bee-friendly home garden, and increasing green space connections in the city

In this paper, 97.1k photos of Beijing were captured by using web crawler technology, and the blue sky and green vegetation objects in the photos were extracted by using the Image Cascade Network (ICNet) neural network model. We analyzed the distribution characteristics of the blue–green space area proportion index and its relationships with the background economic and social factors. The results showed the following. (1) The spatial distribution of Beijing's blue–green space area proportion index showed a pattern of being higher in the west and lower in the middle and east. (2) There was a positive correlation between the satellite remote sensing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the proportion index of green space area, but the fitting degree of geospatial weighted regression decreased with an increasing analysis scale. (3) There were differences in the relationship between the housing prices in different regions and the proportion index of blue–green space, but the spatial fitting degree of the two increased with the increase of study scale. (4) There was a negative correlation between the proportion index of blue–green space and population density, and the low-population areas per unit blue–green space were mainly distributed in the south of the city and the urban fringe areas beyond the Third Ring Road. The urban blue–green space analysis that was constructed by this study provides new aspect for urban landscape ecology study, and the results proposed here also provide support for government decision-makers to optimize urban ecological layouts."
The unfinished project for the socialist city and the legacy of its multiple ecologies,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/127ff427dfca346109781fd0bb0fdc2fb639215e,Jasna Mariotti; Kadri Leetmaa,"The transformation of socialist cities during the lengthy 20th century was closely integrated with the overall economic activities of the state and operated within a system where the means of production were nationalised and central governments were responsible for decision-making, be it spatial arrangement of the economy and political or military objectives of the country. At the same time, the transformation of cities during this period ideologically attempted to promote egalitarian society where access to assets and amenities, and allocation of commodities was consistent and equal to all. Somewhat surprisingly, as the topic has been relatively less discussed in previous literature, urban planning during the socialist era uncovers arguments for sustainable development. Yet, notions of priority during socialism also existed and this indicates some major constraints and dysfunctions in the transformation of cities under the centrally planned system of state socialism. This overview of the book “planning during socialism: views from the periphery” (2024 Routledge) offers some fresh support points to unpack the unfinished research challenges of studies of urban space of socialist cities through transversalities of political, economic and social phenomena that contribute to diverse spatial configurations."

Intervention strategies for renewed living ecologies. The Belgian experience,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12912efbe191f288603b17851fd99a0fbcb920c6,F. Orsini,"Demolition-reconstruction interventions and deep renovation interventions are the main strategies implemented with the aim of adapting the existing residential heritage. In particular, the deep renovation interventions are at the centre of a cultural debate, as evidenced by the research carried out on large modernist peripheral settlements. In this context, it is interesting to investigate how this approach can be applied to those historic urban tissues and smaller centres that strongly characterise the Italian and European territory. Starting from the analysis of several case studies identified in the Belgian context, the work codifies archetypes of intervention on technological units and analyses their limits and potential of application to the Italian context with the aim of opening a debate between conservation approaches and adaptation approaches."
Urban Cascadia and the Pursuit of Environmental Justice,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/129ccf2c24d6b7b92f59c85fcb41efded3ece912,R. Keil,"Urban Cascadia and the Pursuit of Environmental Justice, edited by Nik Janos and Corina McKendry, is a delightful new contribution to the growing debate on urban political ecology (UPE), especially as it is interested in environmental justice concerns, and at the same time a definitive portrait of a region that has long looked coherent to its residents for ecological, historical, geographical, cultural, and political reasons, but has now gained a clear profile beyond the region itself. The book is a timely collection of essays, multidisciplinary and international, by both established and new scholars in and of the Cascadia region, referring in the main to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and the southern part of Canada’s province of British Columbia. Focusing on urban Cascadia, this book is nonetheless not on the region’s big cities alone— Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver stand out—but covers “the infrastructure, social networks, built and natural environments and nonhuman animals and plants that are all interconnected in an increasingly urbanized bioregion, which is also intersected and shaped by national and planetary processes and institutions” (p. 4) as the editors programmatically state in the introduction. They, and the authors they have assembled in the volume, are intrigued by the region’s “imaginary as the center of new forms and practices of green urbanism and environmental sustainability” (p. 3), but dissect its sometimes spectral appearance using three critical lenses for a “dialectical sense of place”: capitalist urbanization of nature, social and environmental inequalities, and “the movements and efforts to construct social and environmental justice out of the first two” (p. 4). For a wide spectrum of readers, among them surely those who have long held a (perhaps prejudicial) view of the region as an extended version of YouTube’s Portlandia and those who are entirely unfamiliar with the area, the introduction provides a rich treat of multiple approaches to the various dimensions that constitute the terrain itself and its ideological domains in which bioregionalism and ecocapitalism play a predominant role that translates into a kind of postpolitical boosterism of the region. The book’s conceptual, historical, and analytical chapters critically take on the chief assumptions of those ideological domains, which are, as we learn in the lucid and informative introduction already, woven through with contradictions of urbanization, race, class, and settler colonialism and inequalities, yet also bear the promise of green and socialist urbanism, environmental governance, environmental justice, and democracy."
The relationship between land surface temperature and artificial impervious surface fraction in 682 global cities: spatiotemporal variations and drivers,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12aaacabecf17994e3cf5ec7e1df2f25785094ed,Qiquan Yang; Xin Huang; Jie Yang; Yue Liu,"The artificial impervious surface (AIS) counts among the most important components of the urban surface, and understanding how temperature changes with the AIS fraction (AISF) is crucial for urban ecology and sustainability. Considering the high heterogeneity among existing local studies, this study systematically analyzed the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and AISF in 682 global cities. The LST–AISF relation was quantified by the coefficient (δLST, ΔLST/ΔAISF) of a linear regression model, which measures the LST change by 1 unit (1%) increase in AISF. The LST was acquired from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily products during 2014–2016, while the AISF was calculated as the proportion of AIS in each MODIS pixel according to the high-resolution Global Artificial Imperious Area (GAIA) product in 2015. Major results can be summarized as follows: (a) LST shows an increasing trend along AISF gradients (positive δLST) in most cities, with annually average daytime and nighttime δLST of 0.0219 (0.0205, 0.0232) °C/% (values in parenthesis define the 95% confidence interval, hereinafter) and 0.0168 (0.0166, 0.0169) °C/%, respectively, for global cities. (b) Daytime δLST varies substantially among cities, with generally stronger values in tropical and temperate cities, but weaker or even negative values in arid cities; while at night, cities located in the cold climate zone tend to have larger δLST. (c) The LST–AISF relation is also season-dependent, characterized by a greater δLST in warm months, especially for cities located in temperate and cold climate zones. (d) Driver analyses indicate that changes in surface biophysical properties, including vegetation conditions and albedo, are main contributors to the spatiotemporal variation of daytime and nighttime δLST, respectively. These results help us to get a quantitative and systematic understanding of the climatic impacts of urbanization."

F. Ferrer,"For many urban artists born in the second half of the 20th century, the street is the framework and the support for their creative proposals. Through their poetic messages they claim it as a space for art and become builders of environments and forms of integral life, since they conceive urban space as the sum of physical and mental space with which the pedestrian interacts, generating a process creative. Some of the urban interventions of a participatory nature are planned and executed with a clear social and educational contribution. The objective of this article is to present different collaborative urban projects of artistic creation that invite to question aspects of society and promote, therefore, an art and an inclusive educational awareness, which provide egalitarian values that allow facing challenges such as awareness of the ecology, hunger, sexist violence and, of course, changing attitudes and behaviours.

Relating landscape ecological metrics with public survey data on perceived landscape quality and place attachment,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12ba40d622859f03f1531c3e1cbc9fffbafaa555,F. Wartmann; C. Stride; F. Kienast; M. Hunziker,"It is essential for policy-making and planning that we understand landscapes not only in terms of landscape ecological patterns, but also in terms of their contribution to people's quality of life. In this study our objective is to test relationships between landscape ecology and social science indicators, by investigating how landscape patterns are linked to people’s perception of landscape quality. To assess public views on landscapes we conducted a survey among 858 respondents in Switzerland. We combined this survey data on perceived landscape quality and place attachment with landscape metrics (e.g. diversity, naturalness of land cover, urban sprawl, fragmentation) in a statistical model to test hypotheses about the relationships between the different variables of interest. Our results illustrate the contribution of both landscape composition metrics and social science indicators to understanding variation in people’s perception and assessment of landscape. For example, we found the landscape ecology metrics on urban sprawl and fragmentation to be a negative predictor of overall satisfaction with landscape, and that perceived landscape quality positively predicted place attachment and satisfaction with the municipality landscape. This study highlights the importance and feasibility of combining landscape ecology metrics and public survey data on how people perceive, value and relate to landscape in an integrated manner. Our approach has the potential for implementation across a variety of settings and can contribute to holistic and integrated landscape assessments that combine ecological and socio-cultural aspects."

Impact of transportation infrastructure on amphibians,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12dce269c76f9f861ed44d0d6f5288aa1978d9f2,Jin-yu Zheng,"In recent decades, the alarming rate of amphibian disappearance has become a pressing environmental issue. The primary cause of this decline and extinction is habitat destruction, posing a significant threat to global biological diversity. This destruction is often the result of habitat fragmentation, wherein contiguous habitats are split into smaller, increasingly isolated patches. Transportation infrastructure, particularly roads, is a significant contributor to the fragmentation. Roads have a huge impact on economic development and ecology, connecting urban areas, rural areas and countries while promoting global economic development. However, at the same time, the accelerated road construction creates barriers, leading to increased wildlife death, habitat degradation and act as a contributor of species extinction. Amphibians are notably liable to road impact because of their unique behavior traits. The relationship between habitat fragmentation, accessible habitat, and populations is complex and multifaceted, with different species responding differently. Therefore, it is crucial to continue the exploration to counteract the problems of habitat fragmentation, the decline in amphibian abundance and biodiversity caused by the development of transportation infrastructure."
Microbial Species Abundance Distributions Guide Human Population Size Estimation from Sewage Microbiomes,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12f0ae279ed32978b312de72230e6502acc2df58,Lin Zhang; Likai Chen; Xiaoqian Yu; C. Duvallet; S. Isazadeh; Chengzhen L. Dai; Shinkyu Park; Katya Frois-Moniz; Fábio Duarte; C. Ratti; E. Alm; Fangqiong Ling,"The metagenome embedded in urban sewage is an attractive new data source to understand urban ecology and assess human health status at scales beyond a single host. Analyzing the viral fraction of wastewater in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shown the potential of wastewater as aggregated samples for early detection, prevalence monitoring, and variant identification of human diseases in large populations. However, using census-based population size instead of real-time population estimates can mislead the interpretation of data acquired from sewage, hindering assessment of representativeness, inference of prevalence, or comparisons of taxa across sites. Here, we show that taxon abundance and sub-species diversisty in gut-associated microbiomes are new feature space to utilize for human population estimation. Using a population-scale human gut microbiome sample of over 1,100 people, we found that taxon-abundance distributions of gut-associated multi-person microbiomes exhibited generalizable relationships with respect to human population size. Here and throughout this paper, the human population size is essentially the sample size from the wastewater sample. We present a new algorithm, MicrobiomeCensus, for estimating human population size from sewage samples. MicrobiomeCensus harnesses the inter-individual variability in human gut microbiomes and performs maximum likelihood estimation based on simultaneous deviation of multiple taxa’s relative abundances from their population means. MicrobiomeCensus outperformed generic algorithms in data-driven simulation benchmarks and detected population size differences in field data. New theorems are provided to justify our approach. This research provides a mathematical framework for inferring population sizes in real time from sewage samples, paving the way for more accurate ecological and public health studies utilizing the sewage metagenome. Author summary Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is an emerging field that employs sewage as aggregated samples of human populations. This approach is particularly promising for tracking diseases that can spread asymptomatically in large populations, such as the COVID-19. As a new type of biological data, sewage has its own unique challenges to utilize. While wastewater samples are usually assumed to represent large populations, it is not guaranteed, because of stochasticity in toilet flushes; unlike epidemiological experiments collecting data from individuals, sample size, i.e., the human population size represented by a wastewater sample, is a fundamental yet difficult-to-characterize parameter for sewage samples. Researchers would need to aggregate data from large areas and week-long collection to stabilize data, during which, important spikes in small areas or short time scales may be lost. It also remains challenging to turn viral titers into case prevalences, evaluating representativeness, or comparing measurements across sites/studies. This study provides a framework to estimate human population size from sewage utilizing human gut-associated microorganisms. Through analysis, we demonstrate that variance of taxon abundances and single-nucleotide polymorphism as two variables that change with population size. We provide a new tool MicrobiomeCensus that performs population size estimation from microbial taxon abundances. MicrobiomeCensus outperforms generic algorithms in terms of computational efficiency while at comparable or better accuracy. Using MicrobiomeCensus, we detected population size differences in sewage samples taken in Cambridge, MA, under two sampling approaches, i.e., “grab” or “composite” sampling. This study provides a framework to utilize individual-level microbiomes to learn from sewage, paving the way to prevalence estimation and improved spatio-temporal resolutions in WBE.."

The study took a qualitative approach, utilizing historical literature analysis, a field investigation, and in-depth interviews to explore the driving forces and impacts of coastal-zone functional transformation. A total of 26 residents were interviewed individually or collectively, the current situation in the coastal zone with a length of about 16.1 km was recorded in detail, and all the collected elements were divided into six landscape categories for analysis. The results indicate that urban positioning, economic development, policies, and residents are the main factors driving the continuous advancement of the Jimei Peninsula zone. The coast has completed the functional transformation from meeting the residents’ survival needs to tourists’ sightseeing needs. The traditional fishing culture in this area is slowly disappearing with the tide of time, and navigation technology is being passed down through the Jimei School Village. This study reveals the dynamic process of the transformation of coastal functions in representative coastal tourism cities in China, bringing attention to coastal ecology and local fishing culture, and raising people’s awareness of cautious coastal development and sustainable blue-economy development."
Migration as a Challenge to Arctic Single-Industry Towns,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/133be38d1e0d1711f012513c7f88fa0898d5d338,O. Tolstoguzov; M. Pitukhina,"The article examines the influence of migration on the social climate of single-industry towns. The results of studies on foreign labour and intraregional migration in Arctic single-industry towns are presented. It is concluded that in addition to the understandable attractiveness of a higher salary, systemic risks that destroy the social ecology and urban ecology are important for migrants. Moreover, it should be taken into account that certain spheres of public life in the Arctic have conflict zones, but do not have institutional solutions for ensuring security. A survey of the local community helped to calculate both the conflictogenity index and the tolerance index. The conflict index is quite high in the Republic of Karelia and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The situation is calm in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and Murmansk Oblast. Both empirical research and its theoretical generalisation have revealed the problems of migrant integration in the Arctic, as well as what can happen with fluctuations in the social climate."
"Evolving Relations of Landscape, Infrastructure and Urbanization Toward Circularity: Flanders and Vietnam",2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1340d1e5c4a53fc0a98a72fd4390cd6d70051452,Bruno De Meulder; Julie Marin; K. Shannon,"A great deal of the contemporary discourse around circularity revolves around waste—the elimination of waste (and wastelands) through recycling, renewing and reuse (3Rs). In line with industrial ecological thinking, the discourse often focuses on resource efficiency and the shift toward renewables. The reconstitution of numerous previous ecologies is at most a byproduct of the deliberate design of today’s cyclic systems. Individual projects are often heralded for their innovative aspects (both high- and low-tech) and the concept has become popularly embraced in much of the Western world. Nevertheless, contemporary spatial circularity practices appear often to be detached from their particular socio-cultural and landscape ecologies. There is an emphasis on performative aspects and far too often a series of normative tools create cookie-cutter solutions that disregard locational assets—spatial as well as socio-cultural. The re-prefix is evident for developed economies and geographies, but not as obvious in the context of rapidly transforming and newly urbanizing territories. At the same time, the notion of circularity has been deeply embedded in indigenous, pre-modern and non-Western worldviews and strongly mirrored in historic constellations of urban, rural and territorial development. This contribution focuses on two contexts, Flanders in Belgium and the rural highlands, the Mekong Delta and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, which reveal that in spite of the near-universal prevalence of the Western development paradigm, there are fundamentally different notions of circularity in history and regarding present-day urbanization. Historically, in both contexts, the city and its larger territory formed a social, economic and ecological unity. There was a focus is on the interdependent development of notions of circularity in the ever-evolving relations of landscape, infrastructure and urbanization. In the development of contemporary circularity, there are clear insights that can be drawn from the deep understandings of historic interdependencies and the particular mechanisms and typologies utilized. The research questions addressed are in line with territorial ecology’s call to incorporate socio-cultural and spatial dimensions when trying to understand how territorial metabolisms function (Barles, Revue D’économie Régionale and Urbaine:819–836, 2017). They are as follows: how can case studies from two seemingly disparate regions in the world inform the present-day wave of homogenized research on circularity? How can specific socio-cultural contexts, through their historical trajectories, nuance the discourse and even give insights with regard to broadened and contextualized understandings of circularity? The case studies firstly focus on past site-specific cyclic interplays between landscape, infrastructure and urbanization and their gradual dissolution into linearity. Secondly, the case studies explicitly focus on multi-year design research projects by OSA (Research Urbanism and Architecture, KU Leuven), which underscore new relations of landscape, infrastructure and urbanization and emphasize the resourcefulness of the territory itself. The design research has been elaborated in collaboration with relevant stakeholders and experts and at the request of governmental agencies."
There is a Garden in her Face: The Georgic O’Keeffe,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/134a63fff6f3cb44b8a050522bcfd92e03dc4d5e,Cristiana Pagliarusco,"Abstract “The cooking has been done for you in the garden; it’s merely finished in the kitchen,” the English biodynamic gardener Alan Chadwick used to say. These were ideas that Georgia O’Keeffe, the American modernist painter, already had in mind when she decided to devote large attention to the creation of vegetable and fruit gardens in her houses in New Mexico between the 1930s and 1940s. When Chadwick, “the gardener of the souls,” started using his Biodynamic Method of organic gardening and farming in North America in the late 1960s, Miss O’Keeffe was already deeply engaged in an agricultural project that had seen her teaching, prodding, cajoling, and strictly guiding her many assistants and guests in New Mexico. Through her idea of hard work applied in any creative context, O’Keeffe anticipated, following the studies of Adelle Davis, an ecology of food instead of an economy. A strong believer in the energy coming from the patient and enduring cultivation of the earth, in its reproductive power comparable to the work and labor of childbirth, O’Keeffe used her adobe gardens, kitchens and cooking habits as a sort of mystical places where labor turned into blessing, giving birth to beauty. Through the reading of O’Keeffe’s letters and books inspired by her life and work, this article intends to analyze the beginning of an ecological, though aesthetically refined, politics of gardening and food in the hands and mind of the modernist artist. O’Keeffe nimbly moved from the stylish urban class-conscious foods and flats of New York City, in the first decades of the century, to the revolutionary culture of local production in the Southwest. In her garden cultivation and food rituals, O’Keeffe reproduced the spiritual landscape that nourished the body and the soul of men and women, both engaged in the prodigious creative project. In addition, her strong relationship with the Indigenous allowed her to rediscover the organic bases of civilization, the “sober reality” (Norman Brown) that helped her fulfill the meaning of her work: giving birth to beauty."

Jennifer Peedom's Mountain as a City Symphony,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/136af4d35072e4a90a896cef86c83b222d13cb1d,Benita Lehmann,"This article explores Jennifer Peedom’s film Mountain (2017) through the lens of the city symphony in view of structural, aesthetic, and thematic parallels between mountain and city symphony films. Analyzing Mountain in the generic context of the city symphony film draws attention to the deep structural links between urban centers and mountains, and their shared technological and urban infrastructures. This appraoch also harnesses the potential of film studies to revise dominant perceptions of mountains and can help viewers understand mountains as places of density and as dense networks that are developed by technological infrastructure and informed by dense technological, social, and cultural networks. By drawing on media ecology, actor-network theory, and media archeology, I will show that, similar to city symphonies, Mountain explores collective networks beyond the human realm to shed light on mountains as cultural spaces, geological manifestations, and eco-social realities. In so doing, Mountain tries to help humans to come to terms with the deep temporalities of alpine spaces and their technological mediations."

We take the Yangtze River Economic Belt as an example and use multi-source data to analyse land use and cover change, as well as the spatiotemporal evolution of ESSD and human well-being. We explore and reveal the coupling coordination relationship between ESSD and human well-being. The results show that from 2000 to 2020, the overall trend in ESs in the region improved significantly, and the supply notably increased, whereas the demand growth rate was even more pronounced. The supply–demand ratio for water yield and soil conservation showed little change, with variations of <10%. However, the supply–demand ratio for carbon sequestration declined significantly by 41.83%, whereas that for food supply increased notably by 42.93%. The overall spatial pattern in ESSD presented a mismatch, which was characterised by ‘low supply and high demand in the eastern region and high supply and low demand in the western region’. Overall, human well-being remained stable and was in line with the level of socio-economic development, thereby exhibiting a distinct trend of well-being ‘polarisation between the rich and poor’. Well-being was higher in the eastern and central urban agglomerations and lower in the western plateau and mountainous areas. Over 20 years, the degree of coupling coordination between ESSD and human well-being increased by 0.0107, and the coupling level gradually transitioned from moderate imbalance to moderate coordination. Spatially, Hubei Province, Chongqing Municipality and the Yangtze River Delta were the main ‘high–high’ agglomeration areas, whereas the Sichuan Basin and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau were the main ‘low–low’ agglomeration areas. Based on these findings, we propose the following management recommendations for the Yangtze River Economic Belt and other related great river economic belts: optimise land use structure, rationally allocate natural resources, strengthen regional and external connections and promote regional coordinated development, enhance the implementation of policies for ecological and environmental protection, establish regional ecological compensation mechanisms and coordinate ecological protection in a full scope and focus on harmonising human–land relationships, build a multi-stakeholder collaborative governance mechanism and promote regional ecological protection and the elevation of human well-being."
PROSPECTS OF SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT ON THE EXAMPLE OF DNIPROPETROVSK REGION,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/13d75403d72ead063488eb0310d79db0d45fd37c,Yuliia Goley,"A global imperative that is especially relevant for Ukraine in view of the social, environmental and economic challenges of sustainable development is to ensure sustainable development. Therefore, addressing the topic of prospects for the development of infrastructure in the country's regions, given the fact that Ukraine is currently moving towards the implementation of a wide range of reforms aimed at improving the welfare of the population is a very important topic. First, because the components of the infrastructure are the main principles of quality of life, which affect the level of satisfaction of citizens. Secondly, a highly developed infrastructure complex is able to bring the country to a whole new European level of development. In terms of infrastructure development, the following priority areas are: housing and communal services, transport and communications, medicine, education, recreation system, ecology, social security, culture, as the most important systems that ensure the gradual sustainable development of each region, and the country as a whole. Despite the sufficient attention of state and regional authorities to the development of infrastructure in many regions of the country, there are still problems of existing infrastructure facilities, such as - educational, cultural, sports, medical, preschool educational institutions and schools, hospitals, etc. The degree of wear of which sometimes reaches 60%. In addition, there are problems with the provision of urban and regional transport to meet the existing needs of residents of the city and its remote areas, which provokes significant time to travel, and so on. In general, the quality of most social infrastructure facilities leaves much to be desired, which determines the high degree of relevance of the topic of this article. The article analyzes the current state of educational institutions, health care and transport infrastructure of the Dnipropetrovsk region, identifies urgent problems. In addition, the problems of the development of transport infrastructure (insufficient number of transport units, its unsatisfactory technical condition, frequent breakdowns, high level of wear, etc.) are highlighted, which requires taking measures to increase the level of accessibility and comfort of transport in the region."

Yang; Huihui Yang; Chun Li; Kai Yan,"During the development of rural settlements, the loss of distinctive rural characteristics, caused by the contradiction between urban expansion and the ideal of pastoralism, has attracted widespread attention from researchers worldwide. To effectively understand the development and trends of the Research of Features and Characteristics of Rural Settlements (abbreviated as RFCRS), this paper uses the knowledge mapping software CiteSpace to conduct co-citation analysis, research collaboration analysis, keyword clustering, and keyword co-occurrence. The study analyzes the basic concepts, the literature distribution characteristics, research clusters, key issues, and development trends of RFCRS. The research found that the current key research topics in RFCRS include “Eco-logical services and environmental protection of rural settlements”, “Sustainable planning and architectural design issues of rural settlements”, and “Human settlement environment and service facility construction of rural settlements”. This paper predicts that future RFCRS research trends will focus on the study of landscape features and characteristics based on ecology, climate, and aesthetics; study of architectural features and characteristics based on characteristic factors and hierarchical structure; and research on rural revitalization based on sustainable development principles. The paper also offers four priority research suggestions for researchers from different disciplines."
Improving Urban Habitat Connectivity for Native Birds: Using Least-Cost Path Analyses to Design Urban Green Infrastructure Networks,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/13ffd9655a6b598b0a337fa2b963733f738e7f0e,Maggie MacKinnon; M. Pedersen Zari; Daniel K. Brown,"Habitat loss and fragmentation are primary threats to biodiversity in urban areas. Least-cost path analyses are commonly used in ecology to identify and protect wildlife corridors and stepping-stone habitats that minimise the difficulty and risk for species dispersing across human-modified landscapes. However, they are rarely considered or used in the design of urban green infrastructure networks, particularly those that include building-integrated vegetation, such as green walls and green roofs. This study uses Linkage Mapper, an ArcGIS toolbox, to identify the least-cost paths for four native keystone birds (kererū, tūī, korimako, and hihi) in Wellington, New Zealand, to design a network of green roof corridors that ease native bird dispersal. The results identified 27 least-cost paths across the central city that connect existing native forest habitats. Creating 0.7 km2 of green roof corridors along these least-cost paths reduced cost-weighted distances by 8.5–9.3% for the kererū, tūī, and korimako, but there was only a 4.3% reduction for the hihi (a small forest bird). In urban areas with little ground-level space for green infrastructure, this study demonstrates how least-cost path analyses can inform the design of building-integrated vegetation networks and quantify their impacts on corridor quality for target species in cities."

Solutions for Urban Resilience Assessment in Crisis Time,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1421c348aae6014f13cda3e85122bdc5c9c311ee,Denis-Cătălin Arghir,"Abstract Cities are complex systems vulnerable to a multitude of risks and disruptions that are becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to urban overcrowding. Socio-economic, technological challenges, but especially natural ones, such as epidemics, have proven to be disruptive from several perspectives of human existence. The negative evolution of the disturbing factors led to the extension of the concept of resilience, traditionally used in socio-ecology, in the urban infrastructure. The aim of this paper is a comparative analysis of some sets of indicators, frameworks, and informatics solutions that can provide an image of how cities can become resilient urban areas. An exploratory analysis is conducted by studying scientific resources and specialized articles that address the issue of developing resilient cities supported by innovation and digital technology. With technology approaches, cities can be helped to prevent and reduce the effects of possible blockages or catastrophes, to respond and intervene promptly in case of crises, and to plan and organize properly in order to recover from shocks or stressors."
Urbanization Reduces the Nest Size of Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) in South Korea,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/143069e859cba2923a829c042823e4aaec7ea085,Hyunwook Kim; Jun‐Kyu Park; Woong‐Bae Park; Yuno Do,"Urbanization affects the natural world, with implications for habitat availability and wildlife behavior, notably in the context of South Korea. This study investigates the effects of urbanization on the nest sizes and materials of barn swallows, a migratory bird species. Utilizing comparative analyses across suburban, exurban, and rural regions, the study found substantial variations in nest volumes. Specifically, rural areas had significantly larger nests than suburban areas, whereas exurban nest sizes fell in between. Although a potential explanation might relate to differences in the availability of nesting materials, this hypothesis necessitates further investigation. The study also found that the soil composition in nests varied by location, with sand, silt, and clay content showing marginal differences, but not statistically significant disparities. However, a clear preference for a specific soil texture was evident, along with the finding that forest cover within a 1 km radius of the nest was correlated with larger nest sizes. Land use was further linked to the external volume of barn swallow nests, pointing to a potential interaction between habitat quality and nest construction. Overall, the findings underscore the complexity of urbanization’s impact on barn swallows, emphasizing the need to conserve natural habitats and devise strategies to mitigate the negative effects on these birds. These results contribute to the growing understanding of urban ecology and the urgent need for thoughtful management of human-altered landscapes."

Comparing urban sociology’s human ecology and community psychology’s ecological metaphor,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/144e1359a7601d87dbc537913d0682c9daa06728,Z. Neal,"ABSTRACT This paper explores how two distinct scholarly disciplines both concerned with place-based human behavior have independently developed an ecological framework: urban sociology’s human ecology, and community psychology’s ecological metaphor. A comparison of these two frameworks shows they are similar in many ways, including their foundations, processes, and legacies. These frameworks emerged independently in similar social and intellectual milieus separated by 50 years, suggesting that their similarities could be the product of convergent evolution. These similarities highlight opportunities for cross-disciplinary collaboration, while the differences identified by this comparison highlight opportunities for cross-disciplinary learning."
Nest Ecology and Prey Preference of the Mud Dauber Wasp Sceliphron formosum (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae),2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1456223dbc36063cdf62bb2ca8b6c1cd268fa344,David Yuan; Juliey Beckman; Jaime Florez Fernandez; Juanita Rodriguez,"Simple Summary Mud dauber wasps, Sceliphron formosum, are native to Australia and commonly found in urban areas where they build mud nests on human constructions. Mud nests serve as brooding rooms for their larvae, in which paralysed spiders are provided as food. In this study, over 650 mud nests of S. formosum were collected, analysed and examined. We first identified the spider taxa that were provided as larval food and then reared the nests that contained larvae, prepupal larvae and pupae of S. formosum and unknown insects. By identifying the insects that emerged as adults, we were able to establish the interspecific interactions and reveal that not only do S. formosum larvae use the nests, but parasitoids and any opportunistic insects also utilize the empty nests as shelters. Overall, we documented the prey preference of S. formosum, as well as 16 families and 23 species of insects from Hymenoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera that are associated with this mud nest life, suggesting a complicated role these mud nests play in an ecosystem. Abstract (1) Background: Sceliphron is a genus of sphecid wasps that build mud nests for reproduction. These wasps prey exclusively on spiders, and commonly inhabit human constructions. The nesting behaviour and prey selection of many Sceliphron species are well studied, but despite being a common insect in urban areas, Sceliphron formosum has never been comprehensively studied. (2) Methods: In this study, over 650 mud nests of S. formosum were collected, analysed and examined to establish prey preference, nest ecology and interspecific interactions. Prey preference was evaluated in terms of abundance, diversity and morphology. Preference in terms of morphology was estimated using body length to leg span ratio (BLR). (3) Results: S. formosum largely preys on ground-hunting spiders, among which Salticidae represented the most collected prey. In terms of prey size, S. formosum captures prey with a large BLR. Moreover, an unexpected discovery showed that the enclosed mud nests provide a micro niche that supports a wide variety of insects. Sixteen families and 23 species of insects were found associated with the use of mud nests, comprising the insect orders Hymenoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera. These included important pollinators, new species and native species not recorded in the past 20 years of mud dauber wasp research. We propose the potential of S. formosum as a keystone species, due to its ability to provide a micro niche for native species in urban areas. We also discuss how these results contribute to our knowledge on the role of insects in urban ecosystems and their significance in relation to conservation, ecology and biodiversity studies."

In this context, some urbanists such as Mike Davis or Nan Ellin define this as an  ecology of fear, the culture of fear or architecture of fear, thus emerge the Brazilian films O som ao redor (Neighbouring sounds) (2012) and Aquarius (2016), both by Kleber Mendonça Filho, and the Argentine films Una semana solos (A week alone), by Celina Murga (2007), and Historia del miedo (History of fear), by Benjamin Naishtat (2014). These filmmakers highlight the feelings of paranoia, social discrimination, self-marginalization and delinquency that arise in the context of gated communities closing themselves in; and ways of life that favor urban life and which have led sociologists in the past few decades to talk about “captive cities”, “bubble architecture” or “lock living”.  Keywords: Ecology of fear;  the culture of fear; architecture of fear; countries; Latin American cinema.  "
Ecology and larval population dynamics of the primary malaria vector Nyssorhynchus darlingi in a high transmission setting dominated by fish farming in western Amazonian Brazil,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/147eb98913396a33428723585c1a5588ba1f7578,Paulo Rufalco-Moutinho; Samir Moura Kadri; Diego Peres Alonso; M.

Conn; Paulo Eduardo Martins Ribolla,"Vale do Rio Juruá in western Acre, Brazil, is a persistent malaria transmission hotspot partly due to fish farming development that was encouraged to improve local standards of living. Fish ponds can be productive breeding sites for Amazonian malaria vector species, including Nyssorhynchus darlingi, which, combined with high human density and mobility, add to the local malaria burden.This study reports entomological profile of immature and adult Ny. darlingi at three sites in Mâncio Lima, Acre, during the rainy and dry season (February to September, 2017). From 63 fishponds, 10,859 larvae were collected, including 5,512 first-instar Anophelinae larvae and 4,927 second, third and fourth-instars, of which 8.5% (n = 420) were Ny. darlingi. This species was most abundant in not-abandoned fishponds and in the presence of emerging aquatic vegetation. Seasonal analysis of immatures in urban landscapes found no significant difference in the numbers of Ny. darlingi, corresponding to equivalent population density during the rainy to dry transition period. However, in the rural landscape, significantly higher numbers of Ny. darlingi larvae were collected in August (IRR = 5.80, p = 0.037) and September (IRR = 6.62, p = 0.023) (dry season), compared to February (rainy season), suggesting important role of fishponds for vector population maintenance during the seasonal transition in this landscape type. Adult sampling detected mainly Ny. darlingi (~93%), with similar outdoor feeding behavior, but different abundance according to landscape profile: urban site 1 showed higher peaks of human biting rate in May (46 bites/person/hour), than February (4) and September (15), while rural site 3 shows similar HBR during the same sampling period (22, 24 and 21, respectively). This study contributes to a better understanding of the larvae biology of the main malaria vector in the Vale do Rio Juruá region and, ultimately will support vector control efforts."

The Significance of Vertical Farming Concept in ensuring Food Security for High-Density Urban Areas,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14aaf4a74f5afd7ccead801cb278d565f214fbbb,F. Kalantari; Ashkan Nochian; Faiza Darkhani; N. Asif,"Cities are increasingly turning into megacities due to their enlarged and intense population. There has been a global attempt by designers to spread the view that cities can be potential areas for producing loads of food required by communities and fitted for specific ecologies. A similar trend has been spread to developing countries where it is essential to provide food for local consumption, and serious attempts are made to distribute food materials to protect particular urban communities. Therefore, recent attempts of food security have aimed not only to guarantee availability but also the provision of sustainable, locally-fitted and food production that is not industrialized to sustain the potential for production. The solution seems to be Vertical Farming (VF). Producing food can be brought into cities through VF and this significant step, if taken, can make life in cities more viable. The present research aims to review the VF plays in the future of food production in high-density cities. The present research reviews the body of related literature, both online and printed publications on the issue. VF is a turning point of the millennium in urban designing but not limited to that. It further presents a new type of architecture as both a local and global remedy for the 21st crisis."
Vocal Repertoire of Chimango Caracaras in Rural and Urban Habitats,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14acb08c3b33371597e7e7f684fda44433a16982,C. Solaro,"ABSTRACT. Acoustic communication, such as bird song, is vital in animal ecology, facilitating reproduction, feeding, defense, and more. Variation in bird song may result from adaptation to environmental features such as anthropogenic noise. The vocal repertoire of raptors is essentially unstudied, particularly in urban environments. The aim of this work was to describe and quantify the acoustic repertoire of Chimango Caracaras (Milvago chimango) in rural and urban areas in La Pampa Province, Argentina. I recorded 26 1-min sound samples at each of four breeding colonies (one rural and three urban) during the austral reproductive season of 2021–2022. I recorded 241 vocalizations corresponding to nine clearly distinct call types. Two types of calls made up 50.6% and 19.5% of the vocalizations and seven others made up <10.0% each. Three call types had trills (fast repetitive notes). Average percentage of call types differed significantly between the two habitats (P < 0.01), with more trills produced in rural habitats. Average calling rate was 6.6 ± 5.1 calls/min at rural colonies and 10.7 ± 10.7 at urban colonies. The number of different call types produced was 2.1 ± 1.6 types/min at rural colonies and 2.7 ± 1.8 at urban colonies. The greater calling rate of Chimango Caracaras in urban areas may represent an attempt to improve signal effectiveness among the anthropogenic acoustic clutter. RESUMEN. La comunicación acústica, como el canto de las aves, es vital en la ecología animal, al facilitar la reproducción, alimentación, defensa y otras actividades. La variación en el canto de las aves puede deberse a la adaptación a características ambientales como el ruido antropogénico. El repertorio vocal de las rapaces ha sido poco estudiado, especialmente en entornos urbanos. El objetivo de este trabajo fue describir y cuantificar el repertorio acústico de Milvago chimango en áreas rurales y urbanas en la provincia de La Pampa, Argentina. Registré 26 muestras de sonido de 1 minuto de duración cada una provenientes de cuatro colonias reproductivas (una rural y tres urbanas) durante la temporada reproductora austral de 2021–2022. Registré 241 vocalizaciones correspondientes a nueve tipos de llamadas claramente distintas. Dos tipos de llamadas representaron el 50.6% y el 19.5% de las vocalizaciones y otras siete representaron <10.0% cada una. Tres tipos de llamadas tuvieron trinos (notas rápidas y repetitivas). Los porcentajes de tipos de llamadas difirieron significativamente entre los dos hábitats (P<0.01), con más trinos producidos en hábitats rurales. La tasa de llamadas fue de 6.6 ± 5.1 llamadas/minuto en colonias rurales y 10.7 ± 10.7 en colonias urbanas. El número de tipos de llamadas diferentes producidas fue de 2.1 ± 1.6 tipos/minuto en colonias rurales y 2.7 ± 1.8 en colonias urbanas. La mayor tasa de llamadas de M. chimango en áreas urbanas puede representar un intento de mejorar la efectividad de la señal ante la distorsión acústica antropogénica.

Papadomanolaki,"This article reflects on telematic soundwalking by initially considering the network as it is experienced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It uses learnings and writings about our networked lives (during COVID) to generate a framework in order to understand the artist’s pre-pandemic work; more specifically, in the context of a series of telematic soundwalking performances titled A Certain Geography, of which two case studies are presented here. The network is analysed through a diverse and cross-disciplinary selection of ideas and writings on networked cultures, experimental radio, listening, philosophy, anthropology and urban design. This cluster of diverse theoretical notions become important for the creation of a type of networked listening where the authorship of I often collapses into a polyphonic intimacy of voices and soundings affected by all that is taking place in between, including the distortions created by the materiality of technologies, the different layers of ecologies at stake, the words and voices of those who sound and listen remotely and site-specifically. It proposes an incomplete reception loop where the aspiration of walking on a planned trajectory is constantly contested and destabilised. The network becomes a porous space where the I constantly morphs into a convivial-collective action."
Synergistic effects of climate and urbanisation on the diet of a globally near threatened subtropical falcon,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14cf10325fce13dcdf7656c1bc44c518c627a723,Mohammod Foysal; Connor T. Panter,"Abstract Understanding how human activities affect wildlife is fundamental for global biodiversity conservation. Ongoing land use change and human‐induced climate change, compel species to adapt their behaviour in response to shifts in their natural environments. Such responses include changes to a species' diet or trophic ecology, with implications for the wider ecosystem. This is particularly the case for predatory species or those that occupy high positions within trophic webs, such as raptors. Between 2002 and 2019, we observed 1578 feeding events of the globally near threatened and understudied, Red‐necked Falcon (Falco chicquera) in Bangladesh. We explored the effects of mean monthly temperature, precipitation, temperature differences, and urban land cover on (a) mean prey weights and (b) dietary composition of 15 falcon pairs. Falcons hunted smaller prey items during months with increased temperatures and precipitation, and in more urban areas. However, during months with increased temperature differences, falcons tended to prey on larger prey items. Being specialist aerial hunters, these dietary patterns were largely driven by the probabilities of bats and birds in the diet. Falcons were more likely to prey on bats during warmer and wetter months. Furthermore, urban pairs tended to prey on bats, whereas more rural pairs tended to prey on birds. Mean monthly temperature difference, i.e., a proxy for climate change, was better at explaining the probability of bats in the falcon diet than mean monthly temperature alone. Anthropogenic dietary shifts can have deleterious effects on species with declining populations or those of conservation concern. The effects of urbanisation and human‐induced climate change are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. Therefore, our findings represent a cornerstone in our understanding of how falcons respond to an increasingly human‐dominated world."
Analysis of Land Use Change Effects/Impacts on Surface Water Resources in Delhi,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14d67ad69bf62da6cf40265bd5609e8a2568402b,Sheilja Singh; Rabidyuti Biswas,"Rapid urbanization and haphazard development derive the changes in land uses and affect the naturally available resources which are essential for human development and other lives. Land use changes can undermine the environment and ecology of an urban area. Although many studies on the land use changes, trends, status, directions, and the relationship between them have been conducted for Chinese cities, none of them have been completed for Indian cities and also not for NCT Delhi. The aim of the study is to analyze the impact of land use changes on surface water resources. So, this study aims to analyze the effects of land use changes on surface water resources in NCT Delhi, one water-stressed city in India. The analysis is comprised of changes, trends, status, and directions for surface water resources and other types of land use for showing the effects. Comprehensive tools such as remote sensing, GIS, and the cross-tabulation method are used for the assessment of land use changes, trends, and status. Four decadal (1990, 2000, 2010, 2020) satellite maps have been used to study the temporal-spatial data of several land uses and to calculate the index of land use changes for investigating the trends and status. In the form of results, the comprehensive net change (18.28%) and total change (49.28%) with a trend value of 0.37 show the quasi-balanced, two-way transition and positive changes in the whole area. This metrics-based study shows that surface water resources land use type is decreasing, and built-up land use type is increasing since 1990. Population growth, economic and industrial development were the major factors for the variations in built-up, green, and other land uses. This metrics-based analysis study is an important perspective for protecting urban water bodies from effects of land use changes. These understandings on land use changes and temporal-spatial relationships are important for present and future land use development and surface water resource planning. This study will help the Delhi Government’s initiatives for the rejuvenation of urban water bodies by endorsing the land use regulations on surrounding land uses."

Research on the Construction of a Composite Humanistic Forest Ecological Corridor in the Main Urban Area of Daqing City,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14f7dce46aeef30eb5272ce173e11a3b273e1d5e,Zhongwei Jing; Peng Chen,"The essential significance of forest ecological corridors primarily revolves around their role in enhancing and maintaining balance in the ecological environment. However, an aspect that has not been adequately addressed is their potential in terms of recreational services. Focusing on the main urban area of Daqing City, this research investigates the integration of ecological and recreational objectives, adopting an “ecology-humanity” composite perspective. (1) Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) and connectivity analyses were employed to identify ecological sources and construct an ecological resistance framework, and potential corridors were then delineated under ecological scenarios using the Minimum Cumulative Resistance (MCR) model; (2) then, the resistance system was refined using ArcGIS network analysis to identify potential corridors for recreational scenarios; (3) finally, this study examined the network layout of ecological and recreational routes, aiming to integrate an optimal humanistic configuration of forest ecological corridors that aligns with dual objectives. The spatial distribution of forest ecological corridors in Daqing City’s main urban area reveals a pattern where densely constructed areas predominantly feature recreational corridors and less-developed regions are characterized by ecological corridors. Ecological composite corridors serve as crucial links between these types of areas, mainly enhancing the urban layout and refining its structure."
Urban Ecology for Citizens and Planners,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1511957bff84f23e7f5e3502f7cba4c89cce70a5,G. Hansen; J. Macedo,"Ideal for city residents, developers, designers, and officials looking for ways to bring urban environments into harmony with the natural world and make cities more sustainable, Urban Ecology for Citizens and Planners offers a wealth of information and examples that will answer fundamental scientific questions, guide green initiatives, and inform environmental policies and decision-making processes.
This book provides an overview of the synergistic relationships between humans and nature that shape the ecology of urban green spaces. It also emphasizes the social and cultural value of nature in cities for human health and well-being. Chapters describe the basic science of natural components and ecosystems in urban areas and explore the idea of biophilic urbanism, the philosophy of building nature into the framework of cities. To illustrate these topics, chapters include projects, case studies, expert insights, and successful citizen science programs from urban areas around the world.
Authors Gail Hansen and Joseli Macedo argue that citizens have increasingly important roles to play in the environmental future of the cities they live in. A valuable resource for real-world solutions, this volume encourages citizens and planners to actively engage and collaborate in improving their communities and quality of life."

Urban Sexual Selection,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/153ce164a673c128e8be27f77acb31ae7332be20,T. Sepp; K. McGraw; M. Giraudeau,"Human-modified habitats can present both challenges and opportunities for wild animals. Changes in the environment caused by urbanization can affect who survives and reproduces in wild animal populations. Accordingly, we can expect that changes in sexual selection pressures may occur in response to urbanization. Changes in sexually selected traits like bird song and colouration have been one of the main thrusts of urban ecology in recent decades. However, studies to date have focused on describing changes in sexual phenotypes in response to urban environmental change, and knowledge about genetic/microevolutionary change is lacking. Also, while some signalling modalities have been well studied and linked to human activities (e.g., changes in auditory signals in response to anthropogenic noise), others have received comparatively less attention in this context (e.g., effects of air pollution on chemical signalling). In addition, the focus has been mainly on the signal sender, instead of the signal receiver, thereby missing an important side of sexual selection. This chapter reviews the evidence that sexual selection pressures and sexually selected traits have been impacted by urban environments, with attention to the potential for rapid adaptive and plastic shifts in traits of signallers and receivers. It explores the possibilities that urbanization causes evolutionary change and speciation in wild animal populations through sexual selection. Finally, it provides new ideas for future studies to explore these questions and especially the evolution of female preferences in urban environments."
Advanced flow simulations of estuarine water resources responding to changes in societal demands,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1545ca06bfd292d64777cf366d95032a63fe0b4c,Jin Hwan Hwang; Dong Hyeon Kim; Bo-Kyung Kim,"Water resources of rivers and estuaries have traditionally been managed for local societal demands, including municipal, agricultural, and industrial usages, as well as for transportation as navigational channels. However, as societal demands have changed including urban expansion, economic growth, cultural transition, etc., the land uses also should be changed, and the civil necessities of water have been diversified, and this has raised concerns about the ecology, environment, and water quality issues. This study attempted to address three water resource management issues in South Korean rivers and estuaries, which occurred recently due to the changes in societal demands for water and explained how the most advanced scientific research techniques had been applied. The main issues were 1) agricultural water security and ecological environment restoration in Nakdong River Estuary, 2) water and soil quality degradation due to industrial effluents in Hyeongsan River Estuary, and 3) utilization of rivers as waterways and water quality and ecology issues in the ARA waterway. To find solutions to conflicts of water resources, the series of numerical simulations validated by the field observations allowed 1) assessments of the impact and extent of salt intrusion upon the opening of estuary dam gates, 2) estuarine physical processes to investigate the influence of industrial effluent, and 3) analysis water quality variations resulting from changes in the function of artificial channels. These analyses are expected to provide appropriate and science-based strategies of regional water management."
Reflections on a Post-Covid Environmental Perspective: Claiming for Planning a Share in the Legacy of American Anthropologist Loren Eiseley,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/154ac680efcc1ffce367d706c822bf1a4d3857a3,William J. V. Neill,"The RTPI Gold Medal is awarded at the discretion of the Board of Trustees for exceptional achievement in the field of town and country planning. International in scope the award in 1957 was made to the American urban theorist Lewis Mumford. At the core of Mumford’s prodigious writing, still referenced widely in planning schools, was the conviction that: “The physical design of cities and their economic functions are secondary to their relationship to the natural environment and to the spiritual values of human community” (Mumford, 1967, p. 92). While the inspiration of Mumford, from the pioneering work on ecology and nature conservation of the Scottish planner Sir Patrick Geddes, is commonly acknowledged, less well publicised is the intellectual debt which Mumford owed to the thought of Loren Eiseley of whom he claimed more than anyone else had “sparked his intellectual approach” (Mumford, quoted in Kauffmann, 1967). This contribution seeks to shine a light on Eiseley as one of the lesser known influences on planning thought. While his thinking permeates into the collective planning mind indirectly through Mumford, the case is made that Eiseley’s insights are worthy of joining the corpus of planning theory in their own right. This article is a small nudge in that direction. It begins by noting that the coronavirus gives us cause to pause and to avail of a provoked invitation, integral to Eiseley’s work, to consider humans and the environment on the broadest and longest of scales. After consideration of some of the most important embedded themes in Eiseley’s corpus, the article concludes, not with any inappropriate practice blueprint for the diversity of places, but with some conjectural insights that still have a bearing on a progressive planning outlook."
Changes in Green Space Intensity in Budapest’s 14th district,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/154f9ad2ea42d7abc5f3245103910be2017edea0,S. Jombach; Laura Üsztöke; Yaseen N. Hassan,"This research used the ”Green Space Intensity” (GSI) index to describe the changes in green space within Zugló, Budapest’s 14th district, from 1992 to 2020. The GSI index is based on the NDVI (Normalized Difference VegetationIndex), but the values have been revised and adjusted to high-resolution ortho imagery and validated by VHR satellite images. It has been developed over the last two decades, it is well known and has been used in the last ten years in research to analyze green spaces within the towns and cities of Hungary. Analysis of green space changes provides reasonable decision-support in urban planning and city development. It helps to define the drivers of change and the effects of changes on the urban climate, paved and built-up areas, the urban habitat of wildlife species and the role of endemic, invasive and ornamental plant species in the city’s green infrastructure. From an urban ecology perspective, this research supports better and more sustainable planning and design solutions."

However, Anopheles stephensi, an urban malaria vector formerly confined to South Asia and the Persian Gulf, was recently detected in Africa and may change the epidemiology of malaria across the continent. Little is known about the public health implications of An. stephensi in Africa. This study is designed to assess the relative importance of household exposure to An. stephensi and endemic malaria vectors for malaria risk in urban Sudan and Ethiopia. Methods Case-control studies will be conducted in 3 urban settings (2 in Sudan, 1 in Ethiopia) to assess the association between presence of An. stephensi in and around households and malaria. Cases, defined as individuals positive for Plasmodium falciparum and/or P. vivax by microscopy/rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and controls, defined as age-matched individuals negative for P. falciparum and/or P. vivax by microscopy/RDT, will be recruited from public health facilities. Both household surveys and entomological surveillance for adult and immature mosquitoes will be conducted at participant homes within 48 hours of enrolment. Adult and immature mosquitoes will be identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conditional logistic regression will be used to estimate the association between presence of An. stephensi and malaria status, adjusted for co-occurrence of other malaria vectors and participant gender. Conclusions Findings from this study will provide evidence of the relative importance of An. stephensi for malaria burden in urban African settings, shedding light on the need for future intervention planning and policy development."
Morphological Stability of Rural Populations Confirms Their Use As Controls in Urban Ecology Studies,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1578e2b3fed603645c49059623b8dc5af7a068fd,Tania Regacho; J. delBarco‐Trillo,"
 The expansion of urban environments and how animals may be affected by them are being increasingly investigated, leading to a surge in urban ecology studies. Many urban ecology studies involve a direct comparison between rural and urban populations, or the use of urban gradients along a continuum from rural to urban areas. The implicit, although not properly investigated, assumption in these rural vs urban comparisons is that the rural populations offer a control that represents a lack of the anthropogenic stressors affecting the urban populations. Here we used museum skulls from 14 rodent species to conduct two separate studies, measuring fluctuating asymmetry (FA) as a proxy of developmental stress to assess the effect of anthropogenic disturbance. First, we compared urban and rural specimens of house mice (Mus musculus) to validate our methodological approach. Second, we compared rural specimens from 14 rodent species collected during the last two centuries across Austria. We hypothesised that FA in rural populations has not increased over the last two centuries, which would support the use of rural populations as a proper control in rural vs urban comparisons. We found higher morphological asymmetry in urban populations of Mus musculus compared to rural populations, which is consistent with similar studies in other species. However, we did not find any significant increase in FA over time in rural populations for any of the studied species. This supports the common practice of using rural populations as a control in rural vs urban comparisons when assessing the effects of urbanisation."
Land - Use and Land - Cover Classification Methods: A Review,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/157d5a5d6c648fc029d9d67cef0c970c40aed7b1,M. Salwa Thasveen; S. Suresh,"The physical cover that present on the earth's surface is referred as land cover. It includes forests, water bodies, grass, asphalt, bare ground etc. The data acquisition of the land cover is mostly done by remote sensing. The acquired data is then categorized into different land covers, by the process of land cover classification. The selection of land cover classification method and its complexity depends upon the landscape under consideration. Various researches are going on the field of land cover classification as its application is spreading in to various areas like disaster management, urban planning, management in various fields like ecology, wild life and so on. This paper presents a review on various recent approaches for land cover classification which includes the statistical, machine learning and deep learning methods and its efficiency in classifying different terrains."
Forest Pedagogy towards the Problem of Polish Educational Monoculture: Projective Pilot Studies,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/158041f162164b92e3ee894860457c33b0160238,Michał Paluch,"The development of topics related to the idea of sustainable development, ecology and the climate crisis is increasingly supported by Polish educators, psychologists and therapists. At the same time, forest kindergartens as well as various grassroots initiatives based on the methodology of outdoor education are developing in Poland. The long-term achievements of practitioners - most often employees of the State Forests - for whom the forest education of the society has been one of the priorities since the early 1990s, deserves special appreciation (Wierzbicka and Czołnik 2022). In 2021, Forest Pedagogy was initiated in Poland as an interdisciplinary problem area, aspiring to a scientific sub-discipline (Paluch and Klimski 2022). The first contacts between foresters and educators gave rise to the question: Can the forest become a real “pedagogical medium” (Rykowski 2022), understood as an educational environment? What became clear was the problem of the similarity of the forest monoculture (management forests dominating in Poland) to the educational monoculture of the school and academic classroom system. Each monoculture is created with the view of matching the production demand for relatively identical objects – on the one hand, these can be trees “for boards”, but on the other hand, young people subjected to a systemic process of “labour force allocation” (Parsons 1969), serving the development of consumer attitudes. In both cases, the goal is to accelerate production, artificially stimulated competition, preventing the attainment of full maturity, or replicating an unambiguous and one-dimensional picture of the world. A symbolic illustration of the last phenomenon are the findings of a qualitative pilot study in which two groups of students completing a Forest Pedagogy course were asked to design a forest kindergarten. As it turned out, the respondents most often drew ordered elements of the urban playground infrastructure: swings, slides and sandboxes, in the vicinity of the building of the local kindergarten, which dominated the drawing. What is particularly poignant, in the analysed drawings the forest was only a symbolic background."
Conservation is in the eye of the beholder: Taking a sensory approach to animal management and conservation in Australia,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15815bee7a4096a77cb7129734492ffd14d02114,Louise Tosetto; Laura A. Ryan; Nathan S. Hart,"
 Animals possess a range of sensory systems that are shaped by phylogeny and adapted to their unique life history. The field of sensory ecology studies how animals use these sensory capabilities to acquire and process salient information that enhances survival. Navigation, prey capture, predator avoidance, and communication are behaviours that rely on sensory inputs and are critical to understanding how an animal interacts with the physical environment and the other organisms that share its habitat. Because sensory biology is so critical to the behaviour of an animal, a detailed understanding of a species' sensory capabilities may also reveal novel and potentially more effective ways of manipulating its behaviour for management or conservation purposes. Here we highlight several instances where the application of a sensory ecology approach has been used to tackle challenging conservation problems, with a view to encouraging such an approach in Australian ecosystems. We describe how it is possible to exploit animal sensory systems to control invasive species using sensory traps and reduce negative interactions between humans and animals. We emphasise the importance of understanding and mitigating anthropogenic stressors from the perspective of the animals affected, in both wild animals affected by urban development and captive animals. It is evident that a sensory ecology approach has much to offer in terms of improving animal welfare and the conservation of biodiversity, including through the development of novel technological solutions that augment the current conservation management toolbox."
Sustainability Assessment of Urban Waterscape Belt Ecological Reconstruction Based on LCA–Emergy–Carbon Emission Methodology,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15a53c2b1be193f8bc56069bdb3a974b9308a4bc,Desheng Dai; Di Yao; Yuchen Gao; Junxue Zhang,"Rivers play a key role in regulating urban ecology, which can improve urban climate while slowing the heat island effect. As one of embodied energy in the field of ecology, emergy theory can be used to quantitatively evaluate the ecological characteristics of a system. This will help to further explore urban ecological sustainability in this article. In this study, four ecological riverbank reconstruction projects have been executed to restore the ecology along the banks of the Jinchuan River in Nanjing, China, which focus on the key river–lakeside and waterfront space in the main urban area. The LCA–emergy–carbon emission method was applied through a series of indicators, including emergy indexes and carbon emission indicators. It is important to distinguish prior research, and few have utilized this approach on urban waterways and waterscapes. The results illustrate that the reconstruction system has obvious improvement significance to the whole river ecology. This change can also be seen when using LCA–emergy analysis. In a 20-year cycle, the emergy of the material production stage and maintenance phase account for a major emergy share, followed by the construction stage, transportation process, and design process stage. The sustainability (ESI indicator) has been improved after carrying out the reconstruction projects. By choosing water and gravel as the primary material, the carbon emission can be reduced. The water treatment process accounts for the vast majority of carbon emissions. Secondly, gravel also plays an important role in carbon emission. Finally, an improved measure (clean energy reuse) was conducted to enhance the ecology of the reconstruction projects and obtained a significant ecological sustainability boost."
New insights on climate change and adaptation research in Brazil: a bibliometric and bibliographic review,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15af4a590f06792d5d9ac5512f4264e0b8400b64,J. Chiquetto; M. Nolasco,"We present a thorough analysis of the scientific production in climate change and adaptation in Brazil. We conducted a bibliometric and bibliographic review to reveal and discuss how climate change research has been carried out. We compared a broader climate change research dataset with a more specific climate adaptation research dataset, to understand the main differences and convergence points, and how science conducted from a mitigation and adaptation perspective demonstrates potential to confront the climate change challenges and drivers in Brazil. Four main clusters of investigation within climate change were detected: (1) impacts on forest and plant development, (2) land use and ecology, (3) adaptation/governance, and (4) climate/atmospheric studies. Only about 5% of the total studies on climate change address adaptation, for which three main clusters of research were identified: (1) adaptation actions and policies; (2) urban environment, vulnerability, and health and (3) food and coastal impacts. Although there are strong research trends in climate change for the Amazon Forest, there was less evidence of studies concerning climate adaptation for this and other Brazilian biomes, smaller cities, rural and traditional communities, and poorer regions. Our results shed a light on the more commonly chosen research topics, their strongest points and potential gaps and trends. This can contribute to the scientific communication and implementation of climate actions in Brazil, and a better understanding of the climate science knowledge from the perspective of a middle-income country."
Additive Envelopes: Robotic Volumetric Porous Bricks for Habitat Reformation,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15b41c0c16b35979cb7b42c507842fb9b0f7b03c,Jonathan A. Scelsa,"The story goes that Lou Kahn, gathered his students into a room and began pontificating over personified bricks in what has now become a canonic conversation: “You say to a brick, ‘What do you want, brick?’ And brick says to you, ‘I like an arch.’ And you say to brick, ‘Look, I want one, too, but arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel.’ And then you say: ‘What do you think of that, brick?’ and the Brick says: ‘I like an arch .’ While this rhetoric pronounced the brick’s structural potentials due to the intrinsic disciplinary problems of stacking volumes, it undermined the Brick’s other potential capacities inherent to its volumetric nature. As such, with the arrival of post-modern construction that transformed the architectural envelope into a series of monofunctional layers within a rainscreen, it is not surprising that brick became flattened into a ‘sticker’ as an image-oriented scenographic pursuit neutered of its structural capacity. A two-dimensional graphic element easily commodified by neoliberal corporate culture, as evident from the thinly applied arches in recent facadist developer minded gentrification practices.In lieu of complicity in this culture of thinning, the research pedagogy showcased in this studio championed a resistance to the thinning of the brick based on its volumetric capacity to perform other roles such as thermodynamics or playing host to ecology towards habitat restoration. The promise of this new constructive principle suggests a volumetric wall construction that rebalances the flora and fauna within the urban ecology, while simultaneously lowering the albedo of our buildings’ contribution to the Urban Heat Island. This advanced option studio worked closely with a brick heritage museum sited within a village historically associated with the manufacturing of brick for the 20th century. The studio worked closely with the docents and curators of the existing museum in the processes of site selection, immersive brick production history, and community engagement."

Factors Influencing Emergency Management Performance in China’s Prismatic County-Level Governance,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15c81f7e9549c10168b4ba0eb9d9f98d9f1468ef,Chao Wang; Jixiang Song; Muhammad Sulaiman Tiwana; Wendong Xu,"Emergency management performance (EMP) at the county level in China plays a critical role in linking counties to serve as a bridge between urban and rural areas. This study explores the factors that influence EMP within China’s county-level governance by applying Riggs’ administrative ecology theory. The study examines the impact of normative constraints, favor politics, cooperative politics, and charismatic politics directly on EMP collectively and individually. This study analyzes empirical data using structural equation modeling from Jiangsu Province, which includes a survey of 300 emergency management personnel. The results show that normative constraints have the most significant positive influence on EMP, followed by charismatic politics, cooperative politics, and favor politics. The study highlights the mixed practices of traditional and modern administrative contexts, with the “prismatic” administrative model offering an adaptive governance approach during China’s societal transition. This study advances the theoretical understanding of transitional governance systems and provides practical recommendations for policymakers to improve EMP in county-level governance frameworks."

Golovanov; G. Biktimerova,"Being one of the most characteristic types of plant communities found within settlements, the synanthropic communities of the Republic of Bashkortostan (RB) have been studied since the end of the XX century (Ishbirdin et al., 1988; Ishbirdinа, Anischenko, 1989; Sachapov et al., 1990; Anischenko, 1995; Ryabova, 1996, etc.). At the beginning of the XXI century geobotanical research was actively continued, while significant attention was paid to phytocenoses located within the towns and villages of the republic (Govorov, 2004; Edrenkina, 2005; Yamalov et al., 2008; Yamalov, Suyundukova, 2008; Usmanova et al., 2013, 2014). Urban vegetation is most fully presented in the series of publications on the classification of vegetation of towns of the Southern industrial zone (Golovanov, Abramova, 2012, 2013; Golovanov et al., 2017).

The given article presents results of the long-term (2005-2018) research of vegetation of the towns of Bashkir Pre-Urals, as well as rural settlements of Trans-Urals. 63 complete relevés of new communities for RB included in the geobotanical base of synantropic vegetation of the Southern Urals were used. The geobotanical database was implemented using the TURBOVEG software (Hennekens, Schaminée, 2001). The area of relevé depended on the community size and homogeneity. Classification is carried out according to Braun-Blanquet method using the JUICE software (Tichý, 2002). The identification of new syntaxa was carried out in accordance with the “International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature. 4th edition” (Theurillat et al., 2021). The names of the higher syntaxa are given by “Vegetation of Europe...” (Mucina et al., 2016). The ecological conditions were assessed with use of average values of E. Landolt (1977) ecological scales and processed by IBIS software (Zverev, 2007). Average values are calculated on the following scales: humidification (M), acidity (R), soil richness with mineral nutrition elements (N), humus (H) content, mechanical composition and soil structure (D), illumination (L).

At the beginning of the 2010s prodrome of synanthropic communities of RB, included 7 classes, 12 orders, 17 alliances and 61 associations (Yamalov et al., 2012). Currently, the synthaxonomy of the synanthropic vegetation of the study area requires adjustment in accordance with the modern state of European synthaxonomy. Special geobotanical studies of recent years have allowed expanding the synthaxonomic scheme of synanthropic vegetation of the region. Earlier, data have already been published on new associations for the region of the classes Artemisietea vulgaris and Galio-Urticetea (Golovanov, 2017). This article extends our research.

This article considers the synanthropic vegetation of two synanthropic classes — Sisymbrietea and Digitario sanguinalis–Eragrostietea minoris. These classes are first given for the territory of the RB. The article contains their regional diagnostic species. Previously, they were a part of the wider class — Stellarietea mediae, combining annual weed and ruderal vegetation.

For the class Sisymbrietea, three synthaxa are given: the associations Descurainietum sophiae and Poo annuae–Stellarietum mediae and the subass. Malvetum pusillae urticetosum urentis. The last two synthaxa are new. They unite nitrophilic communities of low-growth annuals along the house walls, fences, shoulders and other disturbed habitats both in rural settlements and in towns.

Association Descurainietum sophiae unites communities found in various disturbed habitats: landfills, deposits, as well as near buildings. They occur mainly within the small settlements of the Bashkir Trans-Urals, less often in the Bashkir Cis-Urals. A comparison of the coenoflora of communities described in territory of RB and in other regions of Europe (Table 2) showed that the composition of diagnostic species groups is quite similar. The greatest similarity is with the communities located in the Czech Republic.

Association Malvetum pusillae, subass M. p. urticetosum urentis (Table 3). holotypus: Table 3, relevé 2, the Republic of Bashkortostan, Khaibullinsky district, Stepnoe, along the wall of the building, 51.81988° N, 58.15081° E, 14.06.2005, author — G. Ya. Suyundukova. We compared communities dominated by Urtica urens described in territory of RB with the closest associations of the Malvion neglectae alliance of Eastern Europe (Table 4). Significant differences are visible both in the almost complete absence of main diagnostic species, and in the features of coenoflora. The cenoses described in the Czech Republic are characterized by the high constancy of Malva neglecta, completely absent in the Southern Urals, as well as the significant presence of species resistant to trampling. This indicates the different nature of environmental conditions in the compared syntaxa. Comparison with other syntaxa of the Malvion neglectae alliance in RB (Table 6) showed that the floristic composition and ecology of the Urtica urens dominated communities and the ass. Malvetum pusillae cenoses are very similar. Thus, we consider the specific subass. M. p. urticetosum urentis as part of the above association. Its physiognomy is characterized by the dominance of Urtica urens. Basically, communities are found within the rural settlements of the Bashkir Trans-Urals in the steppe and forest-steppe zones.

Association Poo annuae–Stellarietum mediae (табл. 3; Fig. 1). holotypus: Table 5, relevé 1, Republic of Bashkortostan, town district Salavat, boulevard Salavat Yulaev, d. 17, house plot, 10.08.2008, 53.34177° N, 55.93038° E, author — Ya. M. Golovanov. Communities dominated by Stellaria media in Eurasia were described as a rule within the framework of weed vegetation. The closest in ecology are the cenoses of the Euphorbia peplus–Stellaria media community described within the alliance Malvion neglectae in Poland (Ratynska et al., 2010). In the ruderal communities described by us, species of the alliance Malvion neglectae and other classes of synanthropic vegetation occur with high constancy. Association communities are found near the building walls of shadow expositions, along the edges of abandoned palisades in the towns of the Bashkir Cis-Urals.

Compare to other syntaxa of the Malvion neglectae alliance in the territory of RB (Table 6), the ass. Poo annuae–Stellarietum mediae occupies the most humidified habitats on slightly less rich substrates. At the same time, such communities have the richest coenoflora due to the presence of species of the classes Molinio-Arrhenatheretea and Epilobietea angustifolii. Communities of subassociation Malvetum pusillae urticetosum urentis are similar in coenofloras and occupy similar habitats.

The ass. Eragrostio–Amaranthetum albi within the class Digitario sanguinalis–Eragrostietea minoris is firstly identified. It combines specific synanthropic communities of railway embankments with predominance of annual species. Associations with the dominance of Eragrostis minor of the Digitario sanguinalis–Eragrostietea minoris class in different regions were compared (Table 8, Fig. 2). Significant similarity of the cenoses described in the republic with the communities of the ass. Eragrostio–Amaranthetum albi located in Kursk was revealed. Differences are probably due to the nature of the use of railway embankments within stations, as well as the accidental drift of certain species."
Industrial zones is the place where the green city originates,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15e80c8ccb87c88c1e57139ab2eb89ec10eca1c0,N. Krupina,"Subject. The article updates the scientific view of the environmental protection greening and the special land use regime as a special city planning means of passive sanitary protection of people from the adverse aerial and technological impact and the recovery of the environment we live in.
Objectives. I identify the specifics of designing and efficient operation of environmental protection greening as an inseparable part of the urban ecosystem. The article justifies the technique for strategic positioning of respective infrastructure projects in order to ensure the protective effect.
Methods. The study relies upon general methods of analysis, systematization of existing viewpoints and published findings, graphic and logic analysis, matrix-based tools to choose an administrative strategy.
Results. I analyzed the air-holding capacity of economic activity in regions and the outcome of air quality monitoring as a risk factor for public health. The article pinpoints operational difficulties in the environmental protection greening facilities and strategic approaches to addressing the issues in order to improve the environmental security of industrial zones. I determine new aspects of public relations and groups of criteria to assess the effectiveness of green infrastructure projects. The article provides the rationale for fiscal incentives for investors and public-private partnership of stakeholders.
Conclusions and Relevance. Considering national projects, such as Ecology, Demography, Convenient Urban Environment, I emphasize the relevance of recovering and rehabilitating obsolete environmental protection greening facilities situated in industrial zones of industrially developed cities. Green projects should indeed comply with a set of progressive results of fundamental studies carried in various scientific areas. There should be fiscal incentives in terms of taxes and depreciation on special assets as the basis for the private-municipal partnership in green assets management in order to enhance the environmental security of industrial zones."
Roadside Infrastructure Support for Urban Automated Driving,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15ea8df1dfd67ac9e00c42ec5501a887207d2dcf,Mathias Pechinger; Guido Schröer; K. Bogenberger; C. Markgraf,"Automated driving offers excellent opportunities for ecology, economy as well as society. Especially in urban intersections, there is a considerable margin for benefits in these sectors. This work takes a structured simulation approach to find answers on the benefit of additional information about surrounding objects of automated vehicles provided by roadside ITS stations to utilize collective perception. We are using advanced sub-microscopic 3D hardware in the loop simulation framework to generate data based on which we can achieve reliable conclusions. Our simulation data set, consisting of 400 simulation iterations, suggests that automated vehicles greatly benefit from collective perception. A lack of roadside ITS station support might lead to a disruptive impact of automated vehicles on the macroscopic traffic flow of urban road networks. If roadside collective perception is introduced to the problem, maneuver time is reduced, and traffic efficiency is increased by 19.8% on average."
Flying-fox ecology and transmission dynamics of Hendra virus,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15ec376871178e94d3edda275a0643cf6b3433ab,Tamika J. Lunn,"Emerging zoonoses from wildlife present an increasing threat to global public health. Bats, in particular, host some of the most significant viral families to have emerged in recent decades, including coronaviruses, henipaviruses and filoviruses. Hendra virus (Genus: Henipavirus) is one such virus, which emerged in 1994 to cause lethal disease in horses and humans in eastern Australia. Increased incidence of spillover in recent decades has been concurrent with observations of dramatic ecological shifts in host flying-fox (Family: Pteropodidae) populations. Wide-spread land clearing in south-eastern Australia has compounded the effects of inter-annual climate cycles on flying-fox food availability, resulting in large-scale fragmentation and fissioning of flying-fox roosts. This has manifest as an increasing transition from a nomadic ecology, where individuals move across the landscape and form large roosts in response to ephemeral foraging opportunities, to residency, where individuals continuously occupy a single roost in an area with predictable (often exotic) food sources. Typical roosting habitat has shifted as a result, moving from forest remnants with dense roosting habitat, to urban areas with more sparse roosting habitat. Incidence of Hendra virus spillover has been correlated with the formation of these urban, continuously occupied population groups, suggesting that recent changes in host ecology may play a role in spillover dynamics. In order to predict and manage pathogen spillover from bats, we require a detailed understanding of infection dynamics within host bat populations.
In this thesis, I employ a multidisciplinary approach to investigate patterns and mechanistic drivers of Hendra virus infection dynamics in flying-fox populations, focusing on bat roosting structure as a driver of virus transmission. In Chapter 1, I describe the spillover process, and outline Hendra virus as a model to understanding spillover of bat-borne viruses. In Chapter 2, I present a spatio-temporal analysis of Hendra virus infection prevalence and excreted viral load from flying-fox populations, to estimate the dynamics of pathogen pressure over space and time, and to elaborate on possible drivers contributing to differences between roosts. This chapter presents a new longitudinal dataset of Hendra virus excretion dynamics, collected over 2.5 years (June 2017- December 2019), and comprising 4,343 samples from five main roost sites. A key finding of this chapter is that infection intensity is variable between roosts within the same regional area, suggesting that spillover risk is more nuanced than previously identified variation between broader regions.
To understand the ecological context for transmission in aggregative bat populations, I then assess spatio-temporal patterns of flying-fox density and distribution within roosts in Chapter 3. I present insights from detailed roost structure surveys, comprising a 13-month dataset from 2,522 spatially referenced roost trees across eight roost sites. A key finding is that tree structure density drives patterns of bat abundance within trees, with implications for transmission in emerging, urban roost types. I then integrate this ecological context into mathematical models of infection in Chapter 4, where I develop spatially explicit, compartmental models of bat roosts, and explore dynamics of infection invasion and spread. I utilise empirical data on roost tree structure and flying-fox aggregation from Chapter 3 to capture the spatial structure of roosts, and contrast scenarios of tree structure density that are representative of observed ecological shifts with urbanisation. In my last research chapter (Chapter 5), I propose a modelling framework to holistically integrate between-host and within-host contexts into these transmission dynamics. Specifically, I propose an alternative transmission model structure to allow the integration of dose-response relationships into epidemiological models. I also demonstrate how changes in the design and accessibility of dose-response experiments would facilitate integration into epidemiological modelling, to ultimately enable more realistic predictions of zoonotic transmission outcomes.
Collectively, insights from this thesis further our understanding of Hendra virus infection dynamics and spillover risk in a situation of changing host ecology. Beyond Hendra virus, the information presented highlights how aggregative spatial structuring of bats within roosts can add substantial heterogeneity to the contact structure of roost populations, with implications for models of bat-virus interactions. I present compelling evidence that spatial structure and flying-fox aggregation may be a missing piece to understanding differences in shedding intensity and spillover risk from roost sites across eastern Australia, particularly in the context of urbanisation and shifting roost structure. These insights will be relevant for modelling studies of other communally roosting species of zoonotic interest, as well as other emerging diseases linked with habitat modification and changing populations, including coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2."
Urban Ecology Aspects: Theory and Development,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15f599ac83b408746d24c0cdc3d8ba96a64f7d13,A. Suvorova,"Issues of spatial development, including Urban Development, based on the principles of “balanced spatial devel-opment”, are reflected in the main paradigm of the XXI century – sustainable economic, social and environmental development. The study of the problems of sustainable development of settlements, especially cities, is now one of the core areas of scientific justification of the planetary concept of sustainable development. On the one hand, the sustainability of Human Settlements Development is often one of the leading topics when discussing in scientific circles the possibilities of a global transition of modern civilization to a model of sustainable development. Today, it is not possible to conduct a professional discussion on sustainable development without the participation of spe - cialists. The concept of sustainable development of Human Settlements has developed into an independent branch, both theoretical and applied, which is now perceived by the scientific community as a natural and integral part of the paradigm of sustainable economic, social and environmental development of our planet. In fairness, we also note that the concept of Sustainable Human Settlements Development has not always occupied its rightful place among the various aspects of sustainable development that it has today. From the Stockholm Summit in 1972 until habitat II in 1996, issues of Sustainable Human Settlements Development were at the periphery of the attention of the international scientific community. Although a separate section is devoted to promoting the sustainable de - velopment of human settlements in the “agenda for the XXI Century”, however, this document does not contain a definition of this concept and is mainly devoted to the issues of effective management and planning of Human Set - tlements Development. Moreover, the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development, as well as the plan of implementation adopted at the Johannesburg Summit in 2002, also do not include it among its provisions related to the sustainable development of human settlements. Thus, from the moment of approval of the planetary concept of sustainable economic, social and environmental development, it should have been quite a long time before the balance of Human Settlements Development acquired its inherent level of problematic relevance today, and most importantly – understanding of its content part. This is due to a number of reasons, both objective and subjective. They are associated with both patterns of development of scientific knowledge and organizational reasons."
The Painted Stork,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15f5d32c3a3434995ef1c2923af209c0a4b70d38,A. Urfi,"A charismatic and arresting bird, the Painted Stork inhabits the plains and wetlands of India and Southeast Asia. This near-threatened species provides a good model through which to explore a variety of ecology and conservation issues. As a colonial nester, it is also useful for considering questions related to evolution and the development of avian coloniality. The Painted Stork sometimes nests opportunistically in the middle of large cities – the Delhi Zoo colony, for instance, has been active since 1960. This offers a splendid opportunity to study the species at close range, as attested by this book's lively photographic component. The Painted Stork is an important indicator of its wetland habitats, which themselves are highly threatened. Since environmental toxins, particularly organochlorine pesticides, travel rapidly along aquatic food chains, the study of piscivorous birds like the Painted Stork assumes special significance. Equally vulnerable today are the nesting colonies, located in marshes, village reservoirs and the wider countryside, including in urban settings. Perhaps because their natural nesting areas are becoming scarce due to habitat loss, colonial waterbirds look for suitable sites in parks and gardens. Hence, the behaviour of this species reflects changes occurring in its environment. Birds also help us monitor the effects of global climate change, and one of the most significant dimensions of the Painted Stork is its dependence upon the monsoon. How exactly do these seasonal rains govern the food cycles in wetlands? And what happens when the monsoon fails? Covering all aspects of Painted Stork ecology, behaviour, conservation and its relationship with humans, this accessible monograph contains a wealth of new insights."

Jöst,"Mosquito-associated viruses (MAVs), including mosquito-specific viruses (MSVs) and mosquito-borne (arbo)viruses (MBVs), are an increasing public, veterinary, and global health concern, and West Africa is projected to be the next front for arboviral diseases. As in-depth knowledge of the ecologies of both western African MAVs and related mosquitoes is still limited, we review available and comprehensive data on their diversity, abundance, and distribution. Data on MAVs’ occurrence and related mosquitoes were extracted from peer-reviewed publications. Data on MSVs, and mosquito and vertebrate host ranges are sparse. However, more data are available on MBVs (i.e., dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, Zika, and Rift Valley fever viruses), detected in wild and domestic animals, and humans, with infections more concentrated in urban areas and areas affected by strong anthropogenic changes. Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Aedes albopictus are incriminated as key arbovirus vectors. These findings outline MAV, related mosquitoes, key knowledge gaps, and future research areas. Additionally, these data highlight the need to increase our understanding of MAVs and their impact on host mosquito ecology, to improve our knowledge of arbovirus transmission, and to develop specific strategies and capacities for arboviral disease surveillance, diagnostic, prevention, control, and outbreak responses in West Africa."
Socio-economic exploitation of edible caterpillars in the bimodal rainforest zone of Cameroon,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/160f388e4032a8f97e6e6baddadd55b983b3a2be,J. Ouaba; A. Souaibou; S. Niassy; M. Lontsi-Demano; M.P.A. Mayi; F. Meutchieye; T. Tchuinkam,"Edible caterpillars are the most traded edible insects in Cameroon, particularly in the humid forest zone, where they are excellent sources of proteins and fats for many indigenous peoples. Their large consumption and their wild harvest have been a major concern, and there is a need for sustainable management. However, specific data on species’ diversity and trade are scarce. Hence, the present study aims to provide an overview of the socio-economic exploitation of edible caterpillars in the bimodal rainforest zone of Cameroon. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with caterpillar traders in six localities covering the three administrative Regions (East, Centre, and South) of the bimodal forest zone of Cameroon. The socio-demographic characteristics of traders, the traded species, quantities, and prices were recorded. Fresh and live samples were also recorded for morphological identification. A total of 129 traders were interviewed, with the majority being women (94.8%). Eleven species of caterpillars were involved in this trade, with the most remarkable diversity observed in the Centre Region. The traded quantity per species varied significantly with Regions, with the overall most exploited species being Imbrasia oyemensis (13,250.44 kg/year), Imbrasia truncata (4,992.30 kg/year) and Anaphe venata (2,589.51 kg/year). The price of caterpillars differed significantly depending on whether the locality was rural or semi-urban. Notodontidae sp. was the most valuable species (US$ 3.63/kg), followed by species of the genus Anaphe (US$ 3.1±0.5/kg). Special attention should be given to the most traded species to enhance their sustainable exploitation. Further studies on the bio-ecology, habitat and life cycle of these caterpillars are needed for the sustainable management of these beneficial insects. Forest authorities should enhance the regulations governing their exploitation and logging of their host trees."

This study aims to explore the coordinated development modes of ecosystem services and resident well-being in the Pingshuo open-pit mining area and the surrounding mine–agriculture–urban compound area in Pinglu District, Shuozhou City. Relevant models were used to evaluate the ecosystem service value of water and soil conservation, as well as ecological sensitivity. Additionally, using the hierarchical multiple regression method, we analyzed the responses of soil and water conservation services and ecological sensitivity to different land use patterns. The results showed the following. (1) The water conservation function (WCF) and soil conservation function (SCF) were greatly affected by land use and supplied mostly by the natural habitat, followed by the open-pit coal mining area. (2) Ecological sensitivity was greatly affected by land use patterns, with obvious differences in the same land use types in different spatial locations. (3) In order to enhance the WCF and SCF of the study area and reduce ecological sensitivity, the area and diversity of forest and grassland should be increased, and the area of open-pit mining, cultivated land, and urban land, as well as the land use compound degree, should be reasonably controlled. This study will help guide the regional land use layout and provide countermeasures and suggestions for the management of ecosystems in the mine–agriculture–urban compound area."

The 14 characteristic influencing factors of landscape photos were extracted according to the Scenic Beauty Estimation value, and the influencing factors with insignificant differences and small bias correlation coefficients were eliminated through multiple linear regression analysis. The results showed that the main factors affecting the expression of the beauty of Tongjian Lake were water ecology, greenway morphology, landscape openness, water area ratio, vegetation color richness, and vignette matching. Combining the abovementioned analysis results, the two-dimensional plan, isometric map, and three-dimensional space are combined to show the main factors in a visual way, and on this basis, the corresponding optimization strategy is proposed. It provides a reference for future urban waterfront greenway landscape creation."
Towards a sonic ecology of urban life: ethnography of sound perception in Cairo,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/164c234863e7b14a0f4d786db6eebd7d87963a78,Vincent Battesti; N. Puig,"ABSTRACT This study on sound perception in Cairo uses a methodological procedure described in a previous issue of this journal [11(3)]. The procedure involves equipping inhabitants of Cairo, the Egyptian capital, with binaural microphones that record the surrounding urban sounds during one of their daily journeys (without the researcher). Participants later describe and comment on the sounds while listening to the recording. Analysis of this material allowed us first to establish an organized lexicon in categories. We identified a structured “natural language of sounds”. The data obtained reveal covert categories that describe three key domains of urban life: the active city, the city in movement, and the relational city. A principal finding is that sound perception systematically relates sounds to their origin, i.e. both the source and its social situation. This socialization of sound led us to the notion of “sound constructs” as products of an immediate socialization of the perception of sound. Experiment clarifies how perception operates in Cairo, notably through territory differentiation using sonic saliences and soundmarks. Finally, we propose a “sonic ecology” of the city: how residents collectively experience the sound dimensions of their urban territory, navigate between very different territories, recognize them and respond to them."
The Influence of Multi-Sensory Perception on Public Activity in Urban Street Spaces: An Empirical Study Grounded in Landsenses Ecology,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/166ed05f6f008d1da884cc6097962038e5dbbb85,Tianqi Han; Lin Tang; Jiang Liu; Siyu Jiang; Jinshan Yan,"The design of street spaces significantly influences public behavior and quality of life. Understanding how various urban street spatial characteristics affect public behavior, alongside the role of multi-sensory perception, enables designers and planners to create more human-centered urban environments. Grounded in landsenses ecology, this study employs correlation analysis, regression analysis, and Partial Least-Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the effects of different urban street spatial characteristics on public behavior and the mediating role of multi-sensory perception. The findings reveal that street spatial characteristics, particularly the Water Surface Ratio (WSR) and Waterfront Density (WD), have a pronounced impact on behavioral traits, with higher public activity frequencies in areas with elevated WSR and WD. Notably, WSR significantly affects static behaviors, such as sunbathing (β = 0.371, p < 0.001), and dynamic behaviors, such as walking (β = 0.279, p < 0.001). While road and water characteristics directly influence behavior, buildings and green spaces mainly affect public behavior through multi-sensory perception. Different sensory perceptions show varying effects, with olfactory perception playing a significant role in these experiences, alongside a notable chain-mediated effect between tactile perception and psychological cognition. These results provide valuable insights for integrating multi-sensory experiences into urban design."

The white paper provides detailed discussion of competing understandings of agriculture, horticulture, and the social problem of food insecurity; the preliminary data that has led to a current collaborative effort to enhance the skillset of people previously not understood as food producers and provisioners, but only as end-user consumers; and the new iteration of the project wherein specific sets of expertise from diverse disciplines are deployed both to offer a more robust intervention, and bring new methodologies to bear in assessing the ecology of a local foodshed. We propose mobilizing existing resources and expertise of the Land Grant/Cooperative Extension system to act as a regional hub for facilitating full community food security (caloric and nutritional adequacy) and food sovereignty (participatory decision-making regarding living spaces and culturally appropriate foodways). Finally, we illustrate how a nexus of faculty, working from a service-learning advocacy perspective and embedded in a participatory action framework, provides a mechanism for bringing together and sustaining a community of intellectually diverse researchers and stakeholders."
"Dynamic Landscape Fragmentation and the Driving Forces on Haitan Island, China",2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/167e63930f7af807e677dc50b38dd3a8d4db980d,Jingwen Ai; Liuqing Yang; Yanfen Liu; Kunyong Yu; Jian Liu,"Island ecosystems have distinct and unique vulnerabilities that place them at risk from threats to their ecology and socioeconomics. Spatially exhibiting the fragmentation process of island landscapes and identifying their driving factors are the fundamental prerequisites for the maintenance of island ecosystems and the rational utilization of islands. Haitan Island was chosen as a case study for understanding landscape fragmentation on urbanizing Islands. Based on remote sensing technology, three Landsat images from 2000 to 2020, landscape pattern index, transect gradient analysis, and moving window method were used in this study. The results showed that from 2000 to 2020, impervious land increased by 462.57%. In 2000, the predominant landscape was cropland (46.34%), which shifted to impervious land (35.20%) and forest (32.90%) in 2020. Combining the moving window method and Semivariogram, 1050 m was considered to be the best scale to reflect the landscape fragmentation of Haitan Island. Under this scale, it was found that the landscape fragmentation of Haitan Island generally increased with time and had obvious spatial heterogeneity. We set up sampling bands along the coastline and found that the degree of landscape fragmentation, advancing from the coast inland, was decreasing. Transects analysis showed the fragmentation intensity of the coastal zone: the north-western and southern wooded zones decreased, while the concentration of urban farmland in the north-central and southern areas increased. The implementation of a comprehensive experimental area plan on Haitan Island has disturbed the landscape considerably. In 2000, landscape fragmentation was mainly influenced by topography and agricultural production. The critical infrastructure construction, reclamation and development of landscape resources have greatly contributed to the urbanisation and tourism of Haitan Island, and landscape fragmentation in 2013 was at its highest. Due to China’s “Grain for Green Project” and the Comprehensive Territorial Spatial Planning policy (especially the protection of ecological control lines), the fragmentation of Haitan Island was slowing. This study investigated the optimal spatial scale for analyzing spatiotemporal changes in landscape fragmentation on Haitan Island from 2000 to 2020, and the essential influencing factors in urban islands from the perspective of natural environment and social development, which could provide a basis for land use management and ecological planning on the island."
THE INFLUENCE OF URBAN GREEN AREAS ON THE HEALTH OF CITIZENS: A REVIEW,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1692ba9e79c9794d1e10122f9dd9b957ab6b2480,R. Absatarov; A. Mamasadyk uulu,"This article provides an overview of scientific research on the health effects of urban green spaces published in journals indexed in Scopus over the past 10 years. 
The main objective of the study was to explore the impact of urban green spaces on citizens based on scientific sources, to better understand and recognize the important role of nature in providing many benefits to human health and well-being, and to promote knowledge in this direction. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to protect and preserve nature as a source of human health, as well as the importance of creating healthy and livable urban environments. Parks, alleys, street trees and other similar urban green spaces play an important role in shaping the urban environment. They create a pleasant aesthetic appearance of the city and have a positive effect on the health of residents. Spending time in green areas of the city reduces stress, improves psychological well-being, physical activity, and reduces the risk of cardiovascular and other diseases. 
The scientific review analyzed 1,521 scientific articles published over the past 10 years on the green zone of the city, urban ecology and the process of urbanization, selected and summarized 26 articles on the impact of green zones on the health of citizens. 
The study results indicate that research into green spaces in the city has been increasing year on year over the past 10 years. Research in this direction, published in journals indexed in the Scopus database, has been published in China, the USA, Germany, Great Britain, Australia, Italy, etc. However, there are no studies of Middle Asian countries in journals indexed in the Scopus database on research topics. Therefore, we ask our colleagues to revive scientific research in this direction."

There are few studies in the literature focusing on the impact of high-intensity human activities caused by relevant policies on urban LULPs. The purpose of this research was to design a framework that monitors urban ecological security by considering the effect of the developing free trade port. The proposed framework was constructed by integrating multi-temporal Sentinel-2 remote sensing images, night light remote sensing data, digital elevation model (DEM) data, and spectral index features such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), bare soil index (BSI), and normalized intertidal mangrove index (NIMI), as well as analytical approaches such as the land use transfer matrix, land use dynamic degree, land use degree and transfer matrix, land use gravity center measurement, and landscape pattern index. The framework takes advantage of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform and was applied to a highly developed Haikou city, the capital of Hainan province. Maps of brightness (SBI), greenness (GVI), and humidity (WET) were created annually from 2016 to 2021, enabling detailed ecological environment quality evaluation and analysis. The advantages of this study are (1) reliable land cover results obtained automatically and quickly; (2) the strong objectivity of the quantitative research on landscape patterns and land use; and (3) deep integration with free trade port policies. Through the research on the ecological quality problems caused by the change in LULP in the study area, the research results show that, from 2016 to 2021, the spatial distribution of land use and landscape pattern in Haikou city had been constantly changing; the area of construction land has decreased, with most of it having been converted into forest land and farmland; the gravity center of the building land has moved to the northwest; the degree of landscape fragmentation has decreased and the heterogeneity of landscape distribution has increased; the free trade port policies have promoted Haikou’s economic development and ecological civilization construction; and finally, Haikou’s ecological environmental quality has improved significantly."

Changing ecological environment before and after coastline filling designs,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/16b5e0b2b51259ced15a31fb23fa2a7b5b01c467,Hilal Kahveci; Makbulenur Onur,"Coastlines are tectonically active places with an impact on physical as well as social and economic restructuring of cities. They play an essential role in the development of urban areas. Furthermore, coastal environments may offer important health benefits. They may also present numerous threats to human health and well-being time to time. With the rapid urbanization in coastal cities, the lack of urban green space and transportation problems have emerged recently, and the cities have grown towards the sea by coastal filling areas as a solution. Especially the construction of highway on the coastline in the Black Sea region of Turkey has adversely impacted relationship between the people and the sea in the city of Trabzon. In this study, initially a literature review was conducted and parameters were specified for coastline usages. A survey study was conducted with 140 individuals who actively use the coastline in the city of Trabzon, in order to specify the past and current coastline usages. The evaluation of the past and current usage shows that people want to meet the sea but feel uncomfortable with the landscape with the fillings. According to the Anova test, the unmodified form of area was chosen to ‘have a more natural landscape (5.77)’ while the modified form of area was preferred ‘to be renovated (4.12)’. This highlights the users’ longing for the past. Therefore, authorities need to address the impact of differences between parameters in depth on the usage of the area on the coastal landscape. Coastal ecology solutions should also be produced with the ecological design approaches."

Hot and bothered: The role of behaviour and microclimates in buffering species from rising temperatures.,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/16d82e6e9d7451dafebf36360008c670c9cd920f,R. Senior,"In Focus: Bladon, A. J., Lewis, M., Bladon, E. K., Buckton, S. J., Corbett, S., Ewing, S. R., … Turner, E. C. (2020). How butterflies keep their cool: Physical and ecological traits influence thermoregulatory ability and population trends. Journal of Animal Ecology. https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13319 Threatened with rising average temperatures and the new normal of climate extremes, species that cannot keep pace with climate change must adapt where they are, or face extinction. The ranges of many British butterflies have indeed extended northwards as the climate has warmed, but this option is increasingly restricted by the expansion and intensification of urban and agricultural lands. On a day-to-day basis, butterflies can thermoregulate using behaviours such as adjusting their wing positioning or moving into suitable microclimates. The extent to which these two options buffer individuals from free-air temperature, however, is not well known. Nor is the extent to which the different mechanisms are exploited by different species, and whether that has had any bearing on species' population trends over the time-scale of recent climate change. Using a simple and easily replicated approach, Bladon et al. (2020) were able to quantify intra- and interspecific variation in buffering ability, and species' relative reliance on the two thermoregulatory mechanisms of wing adjustment versus microclimate selection. The authors report marked variation in buffering capacity, correlated with wing size, wing colouration and taxonomic family. Species also differed in their thermoregulatory behaviours, with some - such as the Ringlet Aphantopus hyperantus and Large Skipper Ochlodes sylvanus-achieving impressive buffering through wing positioning. Others, like the Brown Argus Aricia agestis and Small Heath Coenonympha pamphilus, were more reliant on microclimate selection, and these were the species most likely to have shown declining population trends over the past 40 years. The study underscores the importance of individual thermoregulatory behaviours for understanding species' vulnerability to climate change. In combination with much improved methods for measuring and modelling climate at biologically relevant scales, the approach of Bladon et al. (2020) can and should be extended to identify the places and species most at risk, and the steps that conservation practitioners can take to maximise resilience to climate change. Much attention has been given to improving habitat connectivity to facilitate range shifts, but we should also consider how microclimate availability can be enhanced to allow species to manage when they cannot move."
"Anthropogenic disturbance promotes the abundance of a newly introduced butterfly, the European common blue (Polyommatus icarus; Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), in Canada",2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/16daa7038fea1b4195b85b10ed1238186fa4a3e9,S. Rivest; H. Kharouba,"The frequency of introductions of non-native species is increasing worldwide, but only a few introduced species undergo rapid population growth and range expansion, and even fewer become invasive, leading to negative impacts on native communities. Predicting which non-native species are likely to become widespread and abundant can be difficult when there is a lack of species’ information in the early stages of colonization. Here, we investigate the ecology of a newly introduced butterfly in Canada, the European common blue (Polyommatus icarus (Rottemberg, 1775)), by modelling its local- and landscape-scale habitat suitability in Montréal, Quebec, Canada, and the surrounding region, and by assessing its dispersal ability using a mark–release–recapture study. At a local scale, we found that P. icarus abundance was highest at sites with moderate levels of habitat disturbance (e.g., mowed every 2–3 years), the presence of their preferred larval host plant and low proportional cover of grasses. At a landscape scale, P. icarus abundance increased with an increasing proportion of urban area and decreasing proportion of forests. We also found that P. icarus is a low to moderate disperser relative to other butterflies. Our results suggest that P. icarus may become widespread in disturbed and urban areas across Canada, but that further investigation into additional potential range-constraining factors (e.g., microclimate), especially larval preferences, and modelling of the trajectory of P. icarus range expansion is needed."

However, few studies have examined the mental health impact of greenspaces in developing countries and particularly in Sub-Saharan countries where there have been predictions of likely escalated cases of common mental disorders (CMD). This present study examined the location of greenspaces, whether and how residents of Ibadan city, Nigeria connect with the green environments, and the effect of this access on CMD. The concept of human ecology of disease provided the framework for the study. The SRQ-20 was adopted for CMD screening in a cross-sectional survey method of 1200 respondents., The results showed that the availability, visits and time spent at greenspaces were related to lower levels of CMD (mean CMD score was 8.6, R=67% and R2 =56%). There is a higher prevalence of CMD amongst residents with no greenspaces surrounding their house (35.4% compared to 28.4%). There was also a negative relationship between CMD and participating in recreational activities in greenspaces (β = -0.054, p = 0.021). This study advocates for adequate planning and conservation of greenspaces in designated areas of the city and frequent visit to greenspaces. There is a need for government policies in favour of greenery. Residents are also encouraged to maintain greenspaces around the home."

Feeding status impacts thermoregulation and its repeatability in a diurnal lizard,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/16ee057b331ee6eb3a49c948ed3096a551f28c95,Constant Perry; Fabien Aubret; Alexis S Chaine; Matthew E Gifford; Ethan H Livingston; Maya Moore; Shala Hankison; Eric J. Gangloff,"
 Thermoregulatory decisions impact nearly every aspect of the physiology, performance, and ecology of ectotherms. Thus, understanding the factors which influence ectotherm thermoregulatory behaviors across ecological contexts and environmental conditions is essential in predicting responses to novel or changing environments. Specifically, quantifying such behaviors across the entire diel cycle – day and night – is key to understanding the impact on physiological processes that happen during periods of inactivity, such as digestion. Utilizing high-resolution time-series data, we quantified the diel cycle of thermoregulatory behaviors in fed and unfed common wall lizards (Podarcis muralis) over five consecutives days. We first tested the hypothesis that feeding status affects diurnal and nocturnal thermoregulation. Second, we quantified the impact of feeding status on patterns of consistency and correlation within and among individuals in diurnal and nocturnal thermoregulatory behaviors. Lizards modulated their behavior in response to feeding status, conserving energy by choosing lower temperatures when unfed and by seeking higher temperatures when fed. We observed consistent among-individual differences (repeatability) in thermoregulatory behaviors across diurnal and nocturnal periods. Furthermore, diurnal and nocturnal thermoregulatory behaviors were positively correlated within individuals. We demonstrate that this diurnal ectotherm actively thermoregulates during the night, a finding particularly pertinent in urban environments, where artificial light and heat can prolong the active period of lizards. Overall, this research provides valuable insight into the flexible thermoregulation strategies of a species highly successful in expanding its range, demonstrating the importance of considering both diurnal and nocturnal activity."
Discussion of the Distribution Pattern and Driving Factors of 2 Large Old Tree Resources in Beijing,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/170ea9360e646b3526f3610cb2e06998a04d8f7b,Qingcheng Fu; Erfa Qiu; Yuan Zhang; Lan-Chun Huang; Hui-Chen Wang; Shasha Jiang,"Known as “living fossils”, large old trees play an important role in ecology, landscape, and culture and are an important part of ecosystems and human settlements. The aim of this paper is to provide suggestions for the protection of urban large old tree resources and the selection of large old tree backup resources. First, we conducted a statistical analysis on the composition, distribution, and important values of large old tree species in Beijing and used Downtrend correspondence analysis (DCA) to analyze the composition of different types of habitat tree species. Second, we created a 3 km × 3 km grid within the administrative scope of Beijing, extracted the number of large old trees and tree species richness in the grid, and used geographic detectors to determine the driving factors of the spatial distribution of large old trees, as well as tree species richness differences and their interactions. A total of 40,590 large old trees in Beijing were found, belonging to 72 species, 52 genera, and 29 families. Platycladus orientalis (L.) Franco was the dominant tree species, with an importance value of 0.51. Among the different habitats, the large old trees were found in parks and temples, and the greatest tree species number of old trees were found in communities and the countryside; meanwhile, microgreen spaces had the lowest number of trees and tree species. The distribution of large old trees and tree species was mainly concentrated in the center of the city and the northwest. The distribution pattern of large old tree resources in Beijing is affected by the interaction of various factors. Social factors were the dominant in the distribution of large old tree resources in Beijing. The spatial distribution of large old trees was mainly affected by the scenic resort and historic site (SRHS), and the SRHS and gross domestic product (GDP) level were the most important factors influencing the richness of large old tree species. In addition, the functional value and characteristics of tree species determined the distribution of large old tree habitats. Therefore, the protection of large old tree resources requires developing scientific management and planning by managers, increasing investment in management and protection, and strengthening ecological culture publicity."
Climate targets as more than rhetoric: Accounting for Norway’s Zero Growth Objective,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/172dfb0cd68762d298685ecd90e7ec025989f632,H. Haarstad; Siddharth Sareen; Tarje I. Wanvik,"Climate-related targets abound, but it is unclear how important they are driving actual transformations. Scholars have often taken a sceptical view of official climate discourses, including their ambitious targets, and instead turned their attention to civic, or 'real', action. In this paper we try on the opposite view. Contributing to a 'speculative political ecology', we argue that climate-related targets, even those without hard policies directly attached to them, can render climate change more governable and actionable. In a fragmented, polycentric and dispersed governance landscape, the immutability of a 'hard' number can create coherence, direction and measurability to policy action. We examine a particular target, and its associated governance instruments, which has arguably had a transformative effect on urban policy. Our empirical focus is Norway's Zero Growth Objective in urban transport policy. We follow the target from its first formulation as a soft goal around 2006 and until 2019, when it has materialized as a hard target shaping funding streams and concrete policy interventions, and most likely, emission levels. Arguable, it has been a highly effective frame for triggering policy action. "

Moua; S. Kotchi; A. Ludwig; S. Brazeau,"Transmission of vector-borne diseases (VBDs) relies on the presence of their vectors. Good knowledge of their habitat distribution could inform of their presence and then the potential transmission risk. In Canada, West Nile virus (WNV), a VBD transmitted by mosquitoes of the Culex genus to birds, humans, and other mammals, was first reported in 2002. Since then, human cases have been reported every year. To reduce the health burden of the disease and to guide the vector control efforts, this work aims to provide a map of habitat suitability of the main vectors of WNV, Culex pipiens-restuans, in southern Quebec and eastern Ontario at 30 m spatial resolution. Landsat 8-OTI/TIRS images were combined with existing geographical data to characterize vegetated and paved areas in urban and peri-urban areas and to create a land use land cover map related to environmental determinants of Culex pipiens-restuans. Landscape metrics were calculated to characterize the neighborhood environment. They were used with 1008 presence sites of the vectors to build species distribution models with Maxent, a model based on the maximum entropy principle, and to predict habitat suitability for Culex pipiens-restuans in the study area. The performance of the models was very good, with a mean area under the curve of 0.92 and a continuous Boyce index of 0.97. A habitat suitability map of the whole study area was created for Culex pipiens-restuans. The resulting map and environment analysis highlight the importance of the edge of vegetation and mixed or paved areas for the bio-ecology of Culex pipiens-restuans."
Ecological and economic profile of cities: on the way to sustainable development,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17471150eb42e4842a570b92c2b324232f8cf0df,V. Nazarenko; О. Voytovich,"Ecology has become an urgent global problem for modern metropolises. Cities seek to balance their economic growth and preserve the state of the environment. One of the programs that more and more cities are implementing at the municipal level is the sustainable development program (based on the Paris Climate Agreement). This study presents cities' environmental and economic profiles through the prism of their economy. The main focus of the work is on waste management, reducing harmful emissions, and increasing the economic development of cities. The principles of integration of a modern green city were worked out and analyzed to determine the optimal strategies for its development. Such a strategy should synchronize the economic activities of the city with the goals of the sustainable development program. A study has been carried out using a multi-disciplinary approach to collecting and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data on the life of cities. With the help of statistical modeling, general social and economic indicators were assessed, and the results of the calculation of important environmental data were presented. Among the data processed, we can highlight the general programs of urban budget expenditures, waste management indicators, and emission profiles. The following three cities were selected to conduct the study and test the results: Kyiv, Paris, and New York. The information on the leading socio-economic indicators of their development was analyzed. The authors considered the norms of the current legislation related to cities' ecology and land use. This made it possible to provide an assessment of the implementations and plans of sustainable development programs. This will allow us to further assess the impact of the sustainable development program until 2035 on the current (annual) level of economic development. Based on the studies, the selected cities successfully implemented sustainable development programs based on the climate agreement in stages. Green areas are expanding in selected cities, and investment in development programs and support for the renewable energy initiative continues. It can be confidently stated that at the local level, harmful emissions have been reduced, and the effectiveness of waste management programs has been increased. For example, Paris and New York allocate significant portions of their budgets to sustainability programs, demonstrating effective alignment between investments in environmental conservation programs and the sustainability of economic development. Despite limited resources, the city of Kyiv is demonstrating progress in modernizing waste disposal systems and adopting EU environmental regulations.The economic development of cities can harmonize harmoniously with implementing environmental programs. First, this is due to targeted investment programs and the adaptation of new urban programs related to the environment. In the future, it is advisable to develop mechanisms of cooperation between municipal authorities, public organizations, and private businesses to solve environmental problems and overcome the negative impact of their consequences. This makes it possible to create a roadmap for effective city management. Such city development programs will improve their environmental and economic profiles, supporting the global pursuit of sustainable development."

Caring of the Fringe? Mediterranean Desertification between Peri-Urban Ecology and Socioeconomics,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1765f58486c88b1ce594c2c0bf21d813068b9d3a,R. Halbac-Cotoara-Zamfir; A. Marucci; R. Salvia; G. Quaranta; Adele Sateriano; M. Cecchini; L. Bianchini,"This commentary debates on the role of multiple socioeconomic drivers of fringe land degradation (including, but not limited to, population and social dynamics, economic polarization, and developmental policies), as a novel contribution to the desertification assessment in Southern European metropolitan regions, a recognized hotspot of desertification at the global scale. Expanding rapidly all over the world, metropolitan regions are a geographical space where land degradation drivers and processes assume typical relationships that require further research supporting dedicated policy strategies. To assure a better comprehension of the environmental-economic nexus at the base of land degradation in peri-urban areas, we provided a classification of relevant socioeconomic and territorial dimensions in both macro-scale and micro-scale degradation processes. We also identified the related (contextual) factors that determine an increased risk of desertification in metropolitan regions. Micro-scale factors, such as agricultural prices and off-farm employment, reflect some potential causes of fringe land degradation, with a mostly local and on-site role. Technological change, agricultural prices, and household income influence land vulnerability, but their impact on fringe land degradation was less investigated and supposed to be quite moderate in most cases. Macro-scale factors such as population density, rural poverty, and environmental policies—being extensively studied on a qualitative base—were taken as important drivers of fringe land degradation, although their impact still remains undefined. Regional disparities in land resource distribution, rural poverty, and unsustainable management of environmental resources like soil and water were indirect consequences of land degradation in peri-urban districts. Based on a comparative review of theoretical and empirical findings, strategies mitigating degradation of fringe land and reducing desertification risk in potentially affected metropolitan regions were finally discussed for the Northern Mediterranean basin and generalized to other socioeconomic contexts."
Pervasiveness of Biological Impacts of Artificial Light at Night,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1770cb124c7b7907c49952cc51a868a1e371bfa1,K. Gaston; Simone Ackermann; J. Bennie; D. Cox; Benjamin B. Phillips; Alejandro Sánchez de Miguel; D. Sanders,"Abstract Artificial light at night (ALAN) and its associated biological impacts have regularly been characterized as predominantly urban issues. Although far from trivial, this would imply that these impacts only affect ecosystems that are already heavily modified by humans and are relatively limited in their spatial extent, at least as compared with some key anthropogenic pressures on the environment that attract much more scientific and public attention, such as climate change or plastic pollution. However, there are a number of reasons to believe that ALAN and its impacts are more pervasive, and therefore need to be viewed from a broader geographic perspective rather than an essentially urban one. Here we address, in turn, 11 key issues when considering the degree of spatial pervasiveness of the biological impacts of ALAN. First, the global extent of ALAN is likely itself commonly underestimated, as a consequence of limitations of available remote sensing data sources and how these are processed. Second and third, more isolated (rural) and mobile (e.g., vehicle headlight) sources of ALAN may have both very widespread and important biological influences. Fourth and fifth, the occurrence and impacts of ALAN in marine systems and other remote settings, need much greater consideration. Sixth, seventh, and eighth, there is growing evidence for important biological impacts of ALAN at low light levels, from skyglow, and over long distances (because of the altitudes from which it may be viewed by some organisms), all of which would increase the areas over which impacts are occurring. Ninth and tenth, ALAN may exert indirect biological effects that may further expand these areas, because it has a landscape ecology (modifying movement and dispersal and so hence with effects beyond the direct extent of ALAN), and because ALAN interacts with other anthropogenic pressures on the environment. Finally, ALAN is not stable, but increasing rapidly in global extent, and shifting toward wavelengths of light that often have greater biological impacts."
Frontier: Reflections on the Meaning and Fertility of This Concept in Amazonian Urban Studies,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17b34ca613b68b76e89e976d87bccde4e2e5c4ae,Antonio di Campli,"Frontiers are generally defined as sparsely populated peripheral geographic areas compared to the political-economic centers in which demographic or accelerated technological processes are manifested. In Amazonia, the frontier have been characterized as the first wave of modernity to penetrate the coast of unexplored territories. The definitions of frontiers in the Amazon have been linked to colonial, imperial forces and capitalist economies. All have caused the arrival and formation of several social groups that, as a whole, have defined the long-term globalization process. But this region, in any case, does not fall within this definition. Modernity has reached its shores for centuries, and Amazonians have reacted in so many ways that Amazonian space and society is a fragmented skirt of time frames. In this sense, the hypothesis supported by this article, in urban and territorial studies, is that the common characterization of Amazonia as a frontier should be deeply revised. This territory has been part of the capitalist world system for more than five centuries and may be better be conceived and interpreted as a composition of enclave environments, economies and ecologies, whose relationships to external political and socio-economic powers is deeply rooted and far less fragile than the frontier usage implies. Methodologically, the analysis focuses on socio-spatial and territorial planning literature about Amazonia and concerning Amazonian territorial constructions highlighting those many factors that seem to contribute to the continued plausibility of the frontier notion. Principal results are related to the construction of a critique to the sense, value and fertility of the concept of 'frontier' un urban and territorial planning practices in contemporary Amazonian territories."

It contends that, while metabolic circulation hides socioecological costs in one place to facilitate valorization in another, specific spatial configurations emerge through territorialization?of waste economies, in this case?providing the spatial base to realize metabolic flows and to anchor political narratives. A decisive effect is that certain patterns of urbanization become locked-in, impeding alternative metabolic transitions and spatial configurations. Attending to the coproduction of three sites?Naples, Italy; Zwentendorf, Austria; and St Polten, Austria?through the circulation and transformation of waste and energy the article provides an empirical multi-sited case study of a political ecology of urbanization."

Community participation in subsistence and commercial urban agriculture was found to be related to each actor's goals and interests. Joining the next urban agriculture group does not guarantee that the community has complete control over the farm, so this study aims to understand community participation in urban agriculture through a political ecology perspective to understand the involvement and interrelationships between actors. In this study, the level of community participation is measured using Arnstein's degree of participation. The method used in this research is a mixed method and a t-test. The results obtained in this study show differences in the motivation of commercial and subsistence farmers in joining farmer groups and urban agriculture. The level of community participation shows that subsistence and commercial agriculture have reached a degree of citizen power, although at different levels, namely subsistence agriculture at the partnership level and commercial agriculture at the citizen control level. This difference is influenced by various dynamics faced, including subsistence agriculture, which still has limited knowledge, lack of human resources, and depends on program administrators and commercial agriculture, which still pays less attention to environmental aspects, which is a factor that makes realizing the sustainability of urban agriculture still a challenge."

 Pollution of urban rivers not only destroys the river ecology but also adversely affects the health of residents and urban landscape. In this regard, we selected a certain river in Wuhan for research. In this paper, we utilize the modified bypass multi-stage ecological pond reservoir system, set up the front parthenogenetic pond, aeration and oxygenation pond, ecological purification pond and other processes, supplemented with aeration–bacteriophage coupling, filler-type ecological floating island and other technologies to improve the water quality of the river. Results show that 4 months after the operation of the system, the rate of enhancement in water transparency reached 550%, and with a dissolved oxygen (DO) uplift rate of 322%, in addition, this system achieved 77.98, 77.78 and 74.41% removal of the ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD) respectively, and the effluent water quality meets the target water quality standard. The process not only has a good pollutant removal effect, low cost and other characteristics but also can enhance the river landscape and improve biodiversity. It can provide a reference for similar river pollution water quality improvement."
Effect of urban habitat use on parasitism in mammals: a meta-analysis,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17f7aa0de0057cea6602a7a6853d1138fd898ab6,C. Werner; C. Nunn,"Rates of urbanization are increasing globally, with consequences for the dynamics of parasites and their wildlife hosts. A small subset of mammal species have the dietary and behavioural flexibility to survive in urban settings. The changes that characterize urban ecology—including landscape transformation, modified diets and shifts in community composition—can either increase or decrease susceptibility and exposure to parasites. We used a meta-analytic approach to systematically assess differences in endoparasitism between mammals in urban and non-urban habitats. Parasite prevalence estimates in matched urban and non-urban mammal populations from 33 species were compiled from 46 published studies, and an overall effect of urban habitation on parasitism was derived after controlling for study and parasite genus. Parasite life cycle type and host order were investigated as moderators of the effect sizes. We found that parasites with complex life cycles were less prevalent in urban carnivore and primate populations than in non-urban populations. However, we found no difference in urban and non-urban prevalence for parasites in rodent and marsupial hosts, or differences in prevalence for parasites with simple life cycles in any host taxa. Our findings therefore suggest the disruption of some parasite transmission cycles in the urban ecological community."
Research Progress in Urban Pollinator-Friendly Landscape Construction,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/180b9d9bc8606d10d71e00ddb55b0f2d4e83c721,Guiying Li; Hanwen Xiao; R. Tian,": [Objective] In recent years, with the development of human society, many ecological problems have begun to emerge, and the number of pollinators is decreasing. In the whole ecosystem, pollinators, mainly insects, play an important role in maintaining the stability of plant communities and improving the yield and quality of crops. If the number and types of pollinators decrease sharply, the agricultural economy will decline, and the stability of the ecosystem will also be affected. The diversity of urban ecosystems as well as the heterogeneity of landscapes is now improving, with diverse green spaces such as large parks supporting the survival of pollinators, so urban green spaces have a significant potential to develop as pollinator habitat. Moreover, pollinator diversity is well related to urban ecology, and the conservation of urban pollinator communities contributes to the stability of urban ecology. In order to make full use of the protective effect of urban green spaces on pollinator communities, while improving the benefits of urban ecosystems, it is very significant to clarify a systematic approach for the construction of pollinator-friendly landscapes and to point out the future development direction of the field of pollinator-friendly landscapes in Chinese cities. [Methods] This research is based on VOS viewer software to visualize and analyze the effective literature in the field of pollinator-friendly landscapes filtered from Web of Science core database, Google Scholar and X-MOL academic platform. In this way, the research hopes to understand the research trends and hotspots in the field of pollinator-friendly landscapes, and at the same time, to sort out the methods for constructing urban pollinator-friendly landscapes and related cases. [Results] By analyzing the change in the number of articles over the years in each country based on the valid literature, it is found that the field of pollinator-friendly landscapes was in a slow development phase until 2007, with only a little research worldwide. Beginning in 2013, the number of"
Public Space Quality Analysis of Putroe Phang Park in Banda Aceh City,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1823feaa6d24eec5522c83d742465af8c9c2ebb4,Khairul Amri; Mirza Fuady; M. Irwansyah,"Green open space in the form of a city park is one of the important urban infrastructures because it not only functions in terms of ecology, aesthetics, and urban identity but also plays a role in increasing people’s happiness. Putroe Phang Park is a public open space located in the center of the city and adjacent to several other tourist attractions that are often visited by the public. Putroe Phang Park is also a city park with historical value in the glory era of the Aceh Sultanate. However, the public rarely visits Putroe Phang Park to enjoy recreation in the park. Therefore, further studies are needed to analyze the quality and usage of Putroe Phang Park as a public open space in accommodating community activities. The research method used is descriptive quantitative, with democratic, responsive, and meaningful variables, which are used to analyze the quality and usage of parks as public open spaces. The results of the study show that the conditions and factors that affect the low intensity of visitors are the unsuitability of facilities, lack of security level, and lack of education about the Pinto Khop Monument as a historical site. These results show the low value of meaningful impressions felt by visitors to Putroe Phang Park. For this reason, this study recommends increasing the quality and usage of Putroe Phang Park as a public open space by periodically updating and maintaining the existing facilities and complementing other park-supporting facilities."

These benefits are reflected in economic terms as they have a positive effect on real estate values, investment, tourism and the quality of life. In this study urban green space is defined as all urban land covered by vegetation of any kind. This covers vegetation on private and public grounds, irrespective of size and function, and can also include small water bodies such as ponds, lakes or streams. This study aims to find the relationship between green space abundance and social impact in particular on academic progress in Almaty city, South Kazakhstan. Data on green space, academic average point score, and nine possible confounding variables were collated. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed. Multivariate data analysis was performed to produce scatter plots that include regression lines. There was a positive relationship between the proportion of green space and better academic average scores per student after accounting for the possible confounding variables. This study provides some support for the idea that access to green space has a positive impact on academic progress, but by no means is it conclusive."

Toishiyeva; S.Sh. Sadykova; L.A. Zhaksylykova; A.M. Saurbayeva; A.S. Seralin,"In the 21st century, the concept of sustainable development has become a key foundation for humanity's future growth. The sustainability strategy is now broadly understood and influences all aspects of life, including education. Global threats to civilization, including economic, demographic, military-political, environmental, and socio-cultural processes, present significant challenges in socialization and adaptation for the younger generation. It is no longer possible to address these issues without the comprehensive and extensive use of preventive development mechanisms. Undoubtedly, one such crucial mechanism is the sphere of education, particularly the architecture of schools. Therefore, architecture, as a key resource in education, must evolve to a new level. The research's relevance lies in the need to apply new architectural and urban planning principles in designing modern schools that ensure an ecologically comfortable and sustainable educational environment. The study analyzes the creation of sustainable school architecture, using the Bali Green School in Indonesia as a positive example of successful implementation. To thoroughly explore the research topic, the authors utilize insights from natural, human, and social sciences, including ecology, psychology, philosophy, pedagogy, and microbiology. The study identifies five key principles: integrating architecture with nature, architectural identity, permaculture, openness in educational spaces, and environmental well-being."
‘Songs of the Lake’: Understanding Cultural Expressions of Nature through Dwindling Folk-Songs and Mythologies in Bengaluru,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1866a77611bfbc18c522febd955076df165c25b2,A. Sen; H. Nagendra,"Abstract Culture-specific knowledge plays an important role in shaping environmental conservation. Yet we lack a holistic and contemporary understanding of how such local cultural systems interface(d) with ecologies, especially in the fast-growing cities of the Global South which face profound environmental challenges. In this paper, we explore nature-based cultural systems embedded in folk-songs to understand situated social-ecological histories of human-inhabited peri-urban landscapes in the city of Bengaluru in South India. Drawing on empirical observations from the city, we trace local imageries of erstwhile lake-based social systems through folk-songs, mythologies and oral narratives. We demonstrate how many of these cultural narratives, largely embedded within symbolic linkages to the lake ecology, continue to manifest themselves as folk expressions in the city, despite the fact that most of the lakes have been polluted or are managed via restrictions that prohibit village residents from accessing them as they once did for agriculture, livelihoods and domestic use. The songs are also rich reminders of socialities, which, despite being divisive and hierarchical to a large extent, were symbolically and materially embedded in nature."

Based on the relevant theories of urban ecological environment and economic development, this paper explores the development laws of urban ecology and economic development and uses graph neural network algorithm to model the spatial and temporal dependence of the city's ecological environment in a province. The quality data and economic development strength data are analyzed in detail. The analysis results show that the ecological benefit index and economic benefit index of each city in the province have reached above 0.6 after 5 years of development. The level of coordinated urban development has improved significantly compared with 2017. However, in the process of the development of the market economy, it is necessary to rationally adjust the proportion of the secondary industry and the tertiary industry in the urban production structure and continuously promote the balanced development of the economy and ecology."
Landsenses ecology approach for comprehensive assessment of cultural ecosystem services: preferences of students at Ankara University of Turkey,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18ccfa7d8cf77df9fc02e22a14ea13baba706fa3,I. Kaymaz; Ö. K. Örücü; S. Arslan; S. Demirel,"ABSTRACT This study aimed to evaluate and spatially represent university students’ perception of cultural ecosystem services in the urban public space of Ankara, Turkey in relation to the ‘landsenses ecology’ framework. A questionnaire survey was administered to randomly selected students studying landscape architecture at Ankara University via the Google Forms electronic survey. For mapping, the Urban Atlas Project 2018 data were used to show the connection between CES and the land-use types. A hot-spot map was created for spatial assessment of CES using Kernel density estimation. Within the study area, the students marked 87 favourite places. The city centre (Kızılay) was marked as the most significant place to visit by the students. Yet, the majority (63%) of the participants marked an urban green space as their favourite place. Spending time with family and friends was the most selected activity in the rankings with a mean score of 4.90 (SD = 4.10). The hot-spot map indicated that grey infrastructure areas generate CES values as well. Within the perspective of landsenses ecology – where psychological and cultural perception is emphasized – understanding and identifying these values and their specific localizations can be useful in urban landscape management, especially to encourage young people’s involvement in daily urban space."

Stanisci,"Abstract Recent studies have explored the ecological relationship between native urban forests and self-sown non-native forests in large cities and metropolises but further research efforts dedicated to analyzing this relationship in small cities are still needed. To improve our understanding of the ecology of urban native and alien forests in Mediterranean small cities, we analyzed the woody species richness, the community-weight mean of moisture and nitrogen ecological indicators, and soil disturbance indicators in the main urban wood types of the city of Campobasso (Italy), as well as their spatial distribution pattern across a gradient of cover and aggregation of green areas. The study showed that both native oak forests and Robinia pseudoacacia forests contributed to the maintenance of woody species richness. If we exclude the riparian environment, R. pseudoacacia forests occupied small marginal patches, tolerating soil disturbance and a high disturbance frequency, thus occupying habitats where the native oak forests could not grow. Conversely, R. pseudoacacia forests shared the ecological niche with the native riparian forests, which calls for action to prevent the spread of this alien species along river banks. Our results highlighted that urban remnant forests should be considered important assets for the planning and upkeep of urban green areas."

Differentiated Paths of Regional Green Development Driven by Industrial Enterprise Innovation,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19372dcdc494636d4bbd836804578a4e190134f6,Qinya Sheng; Wen Guo; Meiling Zhao,"A fundamental shift in the regional development pattern is crucial to achieving a comprehensive green transformation in China. Currently, innovation-driven green development is a significant strategic option for regional development. As the main body of innovation and the basic unit of regional composition, enterprises have a profound impact on the development of regional economy, society, ecology, and other aspects. However, considering China’s vast territory and significant regional differences in natural environment and industrial structure, it’s necessary to further explore the specific impact paths of regional green development driven by enterprise innovation. Therefore, taking industrial enterprises as an example, based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2016 to 2020, this study verifies the impact of industrial enterprise innovation on the regional green development level by constructing a parallel multiple mediating effect model and dividing the economy into eastern, central, and western regions to discuss the specific impact paths. The results show that industrial enterprise innovation has a significant positive effect on regional green development level, via different influencing paths in each region: (1) The eastern region improves the regional green development level by narrowing the urban-rural income gap; (2) The central region improves the regional green development level by reducing resource dependence; and (3) The western region raises the regional green development level by improving the rationalization of industrial structure."

Invasive Plant Relations in a Global Pandemic: Caring for a “Problematic Pesto”,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/195e222102d660469d4c1870ddef16409a0cd0d2,Gabrielle Doiron,"In Spring 2020, amidst a COVID-19 state of emergency, the City of Toronto's Parks & Urban Forestry department posted signs in the city's remaining Black Oak Savannahs to announce the cancellation of the yearly ‘prescribed burn’ practice, citing fears it would exacerbate pandemic conditions. With this activity and other nature management events on hold, many invasive plants continued to establish and proliferate. This paper confronts dominant attitudes in invasion ecology with Indigenous epistemologies and ideas of transformative justice, asking what can be learned from building a relationship with a much-maligned invasive plant like garlic mustard. Written in isolation as the plant began to flower in the Black Oak savannahs and beyond, this paper situates the plant's abundance and gifts within pandemic-related ‘cancelled care’ and ‘cultivation activism’ as a means of exploring human-nature relations in the settler-colonial city. It also asks what transformative lessons garlic mustard can offer about precarity, non-linear temporalities, contamination, multispecies entanglements, and the impacts of colonial property regimes on possible relations. Highlighting the entanglements of historical and ongoing violences with invasion ecology, this paper presents ‘caring for invasives’ as a path toward more liveable futures."
Use of stable isotopes for assessing urbanization impacts on freshwater fishes,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/199758890cebb5070a746be867ad07368ce9440d,J. Burbank; D. Drake; M. Power,"Continued urban development is inevitable with ongoing human population growth. Urbanization has profound negative impacts on aquatic environments and the organisms that occupy those environments. Urbanization results in habitat stressors including sedimentation, alterations to flow, increases in water temperature, changes in riparian habitat, and changes in the food supply of freshwater systems. In the face of continuing urbanization there is an urgent need to employ effective and practical tools to evaluate the impacts on freshwater fish populations and to better understand the implications of urban development for lotic aquatic ecosystems. Stable isotope analyses (δ13C, δ15N, δ18O δ34S and δ2H) are useful and cost-effective tools that can help highlight and evaluate urbanization impacts on fish populations. Here we review recent developments in stable isotope-based methods for studying urbanization impacts on freshwater fish populations. We identified and review published studies that have implemented stable isotopes to evaluate urban impacts, discuss promising stable isotope-based approaches that have not been commonly applied to the assessment of urban impacts, and highlight the advantages and limitations of the various approaches. In particular, we show how stable isotope analyses can help address both the ecological and physiological impacts of urban development on freshwater fishes in hopes of inspiring more frequent use of the approaches in urbanization studies. We elucidate how stable isotopes can be used to understand the impacts of urbanization on the feeding ecology, habitat and thermal occupancy, and field metabolic rates of freshwater fishes. It was found that stable isotope-based approaches are underutilized to examine the impacts of urbanization on freshwater fishes. We suggest such approaches can be applied more frequently in freshwater environments globally to help assess and actively mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on freshwater fishes."
The Contamination of the Earth. A History of Pollutions in the Industrial Age,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19aba219cb3df698612bc401f14b96b785112a85,Pablo Corral-Broto,"Jarrige and Le Roux’s book appeared in French in 2017; three years later MIT Press published a translation of this excellent work on the history of pollution. The book makes an important contribution to the fields of environmental history, social and economic history, the history of law and the state, histories of science and technology, and political ecology or ecological economics, among other eco-disciplines. It analyses pollution from the point of view of production and consumption, regulation, industrial lobbying, labour pressure, and devotion to economic growth all over the planet. Thus it presents a global history of pollution, divided chronologically into three parts from 1700 to the present day. The first part traces the emergence of industrial pollution between 1700 and 1830, from agrarian states and rural pollution to industrialisation and urban pollution. During this time there was a mandatory distance of more than twenty kilometres of gunpowder factories from cities, enforced by a public health police. But coal cities carried out what they called “the regulatory revolution” (p. 63). These changes in the protection, estimation, and compensation of industrial damage have been widely studied by historians. Jarrige and Le Roux, both experts on France, have managed to extend this story to all the industrial countries of the nineteenth century. The second part, “Naturalizing Pollutions in the Age of Progress (1830–1914),” shows that the pattern was global: instead of shutting down polluting factories, notions of progress required protecting them with new experts and new interpretations of the law. Chemistry became a “new frontier” (p. 106), organised and prepared to pollute without limits for the sake of progress. Thus were born the great chemical multinational corporations at the end of the nineteenth century, as well as new solvents, fertilisers, insecticides, and synthetic products. Legal and regulatory change up to the GreatWar was also global and always aimed at protecting the industry. This explains why public and neighbourhood protests were ubiquitous but unresolved, and not even the hygienists questioned the benefits of chemistry"
Landscape approach to Forest landscape restoration (FLR): Case study of Surčin minicipality,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19c06dbd1e924004c254393a0f2f0101384a32c8,Nevena Vasiljević; Sandra Mitrović; J. Devetaković; Marko Pešić,"“Planning at the landscape scale” is the new paradigm of spatial development which embraces the management, protection, and restoration of the landscape character distinguished through “landscape approach” which differs from traditional sectoral and project-based approaches.
The institutionalization of “the planning at the landscape scale” has shown an upward trajectory since the Republic of Serbia ratified the European Landscape Convention (ELC). The ELC aims to promote the institutionalization of landscape planning, management, and protection across all landscapes, whether urban, rural, or natural. The landscape planning approach integrates the principles of landscape ecology, principles of landscape aesthetics, and transdisciplinary research. This approach is solution-oriented, aiming to preserve, restore, and enhance the landscape’s character – the distinctive structure and image of the landscape. It achieves this through the “conservation and development of landscape patterns (mosaic), considering land use, the relationship between built and open spaces, and the distinct qualities of the buildings."" (Spatial Plan of the Republic of Serbia, 2035).
As one of the novel tools that can effectively support the achievement of national-level spatial planning objectives, the development of the Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) methodology holds the potential for incorporating the following goals and principles related to landscape planning, protection, and sustainable utilization:
- Integrating the landscape approach (emphasizing the value of landscape character) into the forestry planning and management system;
- Forestry development aligned with the recognized values of the landscape character (quality objectives, landscape capacity, and sensitivity);
- Urban landscape restoration, preservation, and enhancement of the characteristic structure and image of landscapes through; a) establishing urban spatial order and preserving remnant elements of the rural landscape (reforestation and afforestation within agroforestry areas, peri-urban mosaics complexes, surface watercourses) in suburban areas; d) preserving space for green infrastructure development, as a measure of the city's adaptation to climate change, and creating a network of green and public spaces that connect the natural and cultural values of urban settlements.
In this paper, we present the Surčin Forest Landscape Restoration Plan case study, demonstrating landscape character assessment (LCA) as a research method. This method evaluates the sensitivity of landscape character, addressing both resource and visual aspects. The methodological approach seeks to address the critical questions of “what”, ""where"" and ""how"" in the context of establishing new forest areas within the broader landscape framework of the forest restoration plan. By providing a strategic and spatially informed approach, it ensures that the restoration efforts are not only ecologically sound but also optimally positioned to enhance the resilience, biodiversity, landscape diversity, and connectivity of forest ecosystems, as well as to improve the cultural ecosystem services of the Municipality of Surčin."

Native American literature written in the city and about the city plays an essential role in reimagining and redefining indigenous space and its representation in modern American culture. This study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring urban space in novel Future Home of the Living God by Louise Erdrich, a Native American writer. Despite apocalyptic symbolism and fictional nature, this novel is both an indigenous perspective on the city space and a reflection of urban Indian experience. By employing an interdisciplinary coordinate system and combining spatial analysis with the transcultural approach, eco-feminism and Foucauldian analysis of power distribution, this study offers some critical insights into Native American vision of urban nature and future, as well as culture, gender, politics, and ecology, while also demonstrating that indigenous people are active thinkers involved in urban discourse."
Can We Use Functional Genetics to Predict the Fate of Nitrogen in Estuaries?,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19e7b42a19d5d7ea9177156dcdb70933f8f79850,E. Raes; K. Karsh; Adam J. Kessler; P. Cook; B. Holmes; J. van de Kamp; L. Bodrossy; A. Bissett,"Increasing nitrogen (N) loads present a threat to estuaries, which are among the most heavily populated and perturbed parts of the world. N removal is largely mediated by the sediment microbial process of denitrification, in direct competition to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), which recycles nitrate to ammonium. Molecular proxies for N pathways are increasingly measured and analyzed, a major question in microbial ecology, however, is whether these proxies can add predictive power around the fate of N. We analyzed the diversity and community composition of sediment nirS and nrfA genes in 11 temperate estuaries, covering four types of land use in Australia, and analyzed how these might be used to predict N removal. Our data suggest that sediment microbiomes play a central role in controlling the magnitude of the individual N removal rates in the 11 estuaries. Inclusion, however, of relative gene abundances of 16S, nirS, nrfA, including their ratios did not improve physicochemical measurement-based regression models to predict rates of denitrification or DNRA. Co-occurrence network analyses of nirS showed a greater modularity and a lower number of keystone OTUs in pristine sites compared to urban estuaries, suggesting a higher degree of niche partitioning in pristine estuaries. The distinctive differences between the urban and pristine network structures suggest that the nirS gene could be a likely gene candidate to understand the mechanisms by which these denitrifying communities form and respond to anthropogenic pressures."
Unveiling the ecological processes driving soil and lichen microbiome assembly along an urbanization gradient,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19f628258bab9c6718397f39ba2a287357816960,P. C. Mawarda; Rens van der Kaaij; Francisco Dini‐Andreote; Deniz Duijker; Michael Stech; Adrianus G.C.L. Speksnijder,"Global biodiversity loss is accelerating due to the transformation of natural landscapes into agricultural and urban areas. Yet, research on the urbanization impact on environmental and host-associated microbiomes, particularly on the ecological processes that mediate their assembly and function, remains scarce. This study investigated the effects of an urbanization gradient on the diversity and assembly processes of the soil microbiome and the microbiomes of three epiphytic lichen species (Candelaria concolor, Physcia adscendens, and Xanthoria parietina). Our findings revealed that the urbanization gradient shaped the soil microbiome, while the lichen microbiomes exhibited strong host specificity and showed no significant changes in diversity along the urbanization gradient. Heterogeneous selection and dispersal limitation primarily governed the soil community assembly and higher community turnover in medium- and highly urbanized zones compared to low-urbanized zones, indicating an increased influence of environmental pressures, altered resources, and habitat fragmentation in more urbanized areas. The lichen microbiome assembly in each species was primarily governed by undominated processes regardless of urbanization level, indicating that both selection and stochasticity contributed to, but neither dominantly influenced, their assembly. The lichen microbiomes further revealed species-specific co-occurrence networks, with microbial compositional signatures and potential functions being essential for lichen fitness and urban ecosystem health. Taken together, our study contributes to understanding how microbial communities are assembled in urban environments, bridging the gap between conceptual theories and empirical findings in the urban ecology of soil and lichen-associated microbiomes."
We All We Got,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a07925a61fec4ec36840271e79ee00e1d721e9c,Ashanté M. Reese; Symone A. Johnson,"Urban ecologies are fraught with inequities, often resulting in humanitarian or charity solutions that emphasize lack rather than communities’ self-determination. While these inequities have been widely documented, the COVID-19 pandemic further reveals how these crises are not the sum result of individual failures. Rather, they are systemically produced through policies that harm people. How do Black urban residents contend with the sociohistorical antagonisms between feelings of scarcity (e.g., food and housing insecurity, underemployment, and financial strain) and aspirations for abundance? Using ethnographic encounters in Chicago and Austin we consider how practices of mutual aid are meaningful both spatially and affectively. First, we explore how mutual aid transforms “decaying” urban spaces to meet residents’ needs. Second, we explore felt experiences of mutuality in social relationships as distinct from authoritarian, charity-based relationality. Thinking these spatial and affective dimensions collectively, we work toward a framework of Black ecologies of care and mutual aid."
"Yellow-billed Magpie Population Status and Habitat Characteristics in Urban Sacramento, California",2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a26eab0095f217c302d53ef80b2c413fb3e9206,D. Airola; L. Douglas; Layla Airola,"Most research on the ecology of the Yellow-billed Magpie (Pica nuttalli) has been focused in oak woodlands and savannas in California’s Coast Ranges; urban and suburban populations, some of which are sizable, have received little attention. In 2020, we studied eight colonies in six parks around Sacramento and in 2021 expanded the survey to 43 sites, detecting 827 breeding magpies. Population estimates based on nest counts were generally higher than those from direct counts, and nest counts were more repeatable and efficient. Counts of recently fledged young in family groups yielded reproductive rates similar to those observed near the coast before arrival of West Nile virus in 2003, suggesting that the virus is not currently affecting nestlings’ survival. Sacramento magpies nested in the upper canopy of a wide variety of large trees, both native and non-native. They foraged preferentially in low herbaceous habitat—irrigated turf and unirrigated annual grassland that was mowed or grazed. The presence of rivers and streams influenced occupancy strongly. Colony size was strongly related to the amount of low herbaceous foraging habitat within 0.5 km of colony sites with nearby flowing water. Our results suggest that at least 4 ha of low herbaceous foraging habitat is needed to support a small nesting colony. Retention of herbaceous habitat near large trees and flowing water, plus mowing or grazing to keep herbaceous growth low, should benefit urban Yellow-billed Magpies."
Rethinking centrality,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a2ab14f991f40c820695a339ebe3372acb22d78,Azat Zana Gündoğan,"In this paper, I tackle the center-periphery dynamics under planetary urbanization by focusing on Gebze, the gigantic industrial city just outside of Istanbul’s administrative borders. Through an empirical study of peripheral urbanization processes in the Gebze-Istanbul axis, the paper engages with the planetary sub/urbanization debates and serves the triple purpose: (I) to emphasize the significance of peripheralization and the center-periphery dialectics to critique the predominant emphasis on centrality in urban and regional research which relegates the socio-spatial and political transformations of the peripheries to the background, (II) to offer an alternative approach to depictions of cities as sentient, anthropomorphic actors in a hierarchical and competitive Darwinian ecology, and (III) to contribute to planetary sub/urbanization debates by zooming in on some of the micro-spaces of peripheral Gebze during the extended urbanization process in greater Istanbul. Through a transdisciplinary methodology, the paper provides a local ontology by displaying how peripherality is constructed not merely from above and the center by the state or economic actors, but also by the people from below and the periphery, as it were, during their everyday rhythms, activities, negotiations, and coping. By resisting the merely expanded application of the term suburban, and instead taking seriously the complex web of governance, agency, defeat, organization, and exploitation within the lives of Gebze’s inhabitants, the article concludes that such phenomena make any universalizing claim about the urban or the suburban incomplete."
"The influence of land use on the pollen diet of honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in Ellis County, Kansas",2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a2ca22f91167bb1a05af00af98359260025ebf2,R. Engel,"Pollinators are integral to plant ecology as well as to worldwide food availability and security. Understanding how human-driven land use change impacts the nutrition of managed honey bees is important in pollinator conservation efforts and can contribute towards combating recent pollinator declines. The objective of this study was to determine sources of forage for honey bees across different land use types in Ellis County, Kansas, through pollen analysis and taxonomic identification. Replicate study colonies were placed in three separate land use types: Urban, Cropland, or Native/Semi-native prairie. Pollen was sampled every 7 to 14 days throughout a growing season (April 1 to September 30) to identify key resources and their availability throughout time and space. Pollen abundance (mass) varied greatly throughout time and across treatments, although Urban colonies trended toward higher pollen abundance and Cropland colonies trended toward reduced pollen abundance. A total of 41 different plant taxa were identified from experimental hives, with willows (Salix) and clovers (Melilotus/Trifolium) observed in abundance among all land use treatments. Taxonomic richness (number of taxa) of floral resources utilized by study colonies was similar between land use treatments, with the exception of a few taxa. Unique distinctions among land use treatments included the abundance of trees in Urban habitat and the prevalence of weedy species in Cropland habitat. Understanding the availability of floral resources in prairies can help to inform conservation decisions and improve understanding of community ecology and health of native pollinators in prairies. Overall colony health and overwintering success could also be improved with a better understanding of how land composition influences honey bee nutrition."
Delimitating functional zones at municipal or county level in China based on a spatial optimization and simulation coupling approach,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a3d90d9388218e04963b03227d251fd7ec23554,Dan Li; Jigang Qiao; Yihan Zhang,"
 <p>Territory spatial planning is a guide and blueprint for future territorial development in China. It means to form a scientific, rational, intensive, and efficient spatial protection and development pattern in territory space. The first task according to the government is to delimitate the functional zones of ecology, agriculture, urban zones, and delineation of ecological protection red lines, permanent basic farmland boundaries, and urban development boundaries (""three zones and three lines""). Currently China used a resource and environment carrying capacity and land space development suitability evaluation (""double evaluations"") to complete the delimitation task. However, the process of these evaluations and demarcation is relatively complicated, high-level human intervention, and the operability is not strong, therefore it is not practically at municipal or county level. We proposed a new delineation framework, methods, and software tools for the delimitation work, based on a spatial optimization and simulation coupling approach, and is verified by an example in Guangzhou, a super metropolis city in China. It shows that this method can rapidly and efficiently delimit urban ecological and agricultural zones based on regional geographic background conditions, by using an ant colony intelligent optimization algorithm, and using a cellular automata model to delineate compact urban zones. Compared with the ""three zones"" division plan in the ""Guangzhou Land and Space Master Plan (2018-2035) Draft"" which is published by local government, the delimitated functional zones by proposed method can meet the quantitative requirements of the draft, while providing more detailed and realistic spatial pattern of the three functional zones, which can be very useful for municipal and county level territory spatial planning work.</p>

Exploring the Factors Influencing Street Landscape Quality by Deep Learning Technology,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a4dbaafdd642c88caa678286b15b30742e819ff,Haozhang Pan; Sheng-Jung Ou,"Urbanization has significantly impacted the urban environment. With the city's ongoing expansion, residents' expectations for their living standards rise along with the consideration given to streetscape quality. Deep learning methods offer more precise solutions for researchers. While previous studies extensively explored street landscapes encompassing assessment, perception, and ecology, deep learning has not yet been employed. Thus, we examined street landscape determinants compared to prior work. In this study, we probed factors influencing street landscape quality, and 2) used the Delphi method to identify quality preferences. The results revealed four primary enhancement strategies. Factors were obtained via deep learning as street landscape preferences and evaluated with the Delphi method in five dimensions: architectural facade, street dimensions, street furniture, street greening, and sunlight exposure (totaling 16 factors). These findings can be used to forecast street design quality and suggest ways to enhance urban landscapes, especially on less optimal streets."

Mohanty; P. Pradhan,"Covid-19 caught all of us off guard and its devastating impact of such a pandemic is being felt in all the sectors of the society. To prevent the spread of this highly life-threatening disease, the governments on all levels had imposed, inter alia, lockdown measures.  As a result of this, the schools, colleges, offices were shut and the air and road travel was very restricted in the country. The movement of the people was restricted and very few vehicles were on the road. Though the lockdown brought many difficulties for the people, but is a blessing in disguise. Due to people were remaining in homes and transportation was being minimal, there has been a significant improvement in the quality of environment and ecology. The urban environmental parameters like traffic noise emissions and noise indices, concentration of air pollutant was decreased considerably. The present work analyzes the environmental impact of lockdown in Berhampur city. The study reveals that the noise levels and noise pollution indices was decreased drastically. Also, the air pollution level was decreased considerably."
"Reporting Cannibalistic Behavior in the Yellow Belly Gecko Hemidactylus flaviviridis, Ruppell, 1835 (Reptilia: Gekkonidae), from Ahmednagar District of Maharashtra, India",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a64653536805097e81a6ec54d4f818f8d74c01a,D. K. Narwade; B. V. Deore; R. J. S.; V. E.,"The purpose of this research is to record, examine and document instances of cannibalistic behavior in the yellow-bellied gecko (Hemidactylus flaviviridis Ruppell, 1835) in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Although it hasn't been studied in great detail, cannibalism in reptiles provides important insights into the behavioral ecology of species, especially in settings with limited resources. Observation was conducted in semi-urban habitats in Maharashtra. A direct visual encounter was used to document the cannibalism incident. To ascertain the size and age classes of both predators and prey, morphological measures were made. An adult gecko was shown to have engaged in cannibalism. Predation was most common in the premonsoon season when there was little other prey available. Predator geckos were noticeably bigger on average than their prey counterparts. According to the analysis, cannibalism might be a survival tactic used when food supplies are scarce. Behavioral observations suggested that cannibalism was not a regular feeding habit, but rather an opportunistic behavior. The findings of this study offer the first proof of cannibalism in the Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra's Hemidactylus flaviviridis. The results underscore the species' ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions by implying that resource scarcity may be the driving force behind this behavior. Comprehending these actions is essential for gaining a wider understanding of the species' ecology and could have consequences for managing and conserving them."

Cianfanelli; Maria Claudia Coppola; Margherita Tufarelli,"With artificial intelligence being tirelessly trained and constantly learning about subjects and objects inhabiting given environments, whole new ecosystems have been rising and developing, where beings and things are equally entangled in boundaries, connections and relationships, capable of enacting their own agencies at any time.In fact, since everyday life becomes more and more home to smart objects related to the Internet of Things paradigm at different scales of innovation - private, social, urban systems -, the resulting overcrowded ecologies seem to ask to be tackled through design approaches focusing not only on artifacts understood at a limited stage of use and as passive tools related to human agency only. Autonomous vehicles, robots, sensing surfaces, recording devices are populating society in increasing numbers, pushing the social sphere towards its more-than-human futures. In this sense, the resulting computational environment produces a more-than-human experience, with all its clustering, classifying and patterning information happening almost instantaneously and often without the need of a perceiving subject. This leads to a significant change in the way information is experienced and used: examining the interlocking nature of humans and technology by looking at the way technology is humanised, and humans are technologised, it seems that smart objects are gaining complex features like being deliberative, reflectional, experiential and communicative, allowing them to produce both reflectional knowledge, - namely knowledge which humans can use to think about phenomena with new insights - and actionable knowledge - namely knowledge which non-human actants can use to do things and achieve goals. Thus, human knowledge and data-driven knowledge promote specific values, influencing collective life, launching a twofold challenge in overcrowded ecologies: from one side, designers might address thing factors so that they could sense and understand the world through more-than-human values; from the other side designers might address being factors to build meaning through shared values.As both beings and things learn and act, the world is full of extended agencies, where it is not worth distinguishing whether humans extend their own agency through objects or vice versa. According to the “hybrid” behaviorism making its way and leading to new insights for design culture, the contribution aims at investigating more-than-human factors and values in times of hyper-communication, where contemporary landscapes appear so heterogeneously populated, that embracing diversity and the radical interdependence it entails means grasping the diverse needs of design beneficiaries, be they beings or things. Synthetic and organic agency, natural and machinical ones: it is very likely that designers will not only design with them, but also for them: networks of natural and computational entities can in fact be thought of not only given objects - wheter they be enabler or disabler - but agents participating in the design space, triggering the development of corresponding design methods, frameworks, and practices to better address the challenges to be faced today as a planet. Thus, designing in overcrowded ecologies becomes a matter of care and inspires designers into shaping more-than-human communities, expanding their disciplinary areas of practice as an exercise of stewardship within society."
Assessing Benefits and Risks of Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture (UPA): A Spatial Approach,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a708d9a63deb1ad9d479ef29a8fa6509efeae83,Enrico Gottero,"The benefits and positive effects of urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) on different urban dimensions have already been extensively recognized by scholars and practitioners so far. Even possible risks of these professional and non-professional activities have been discussed, especially in the field of landscape ecology and from a social perspective. However, how these benefits are measured, monitored and assessed is still a critical point and a less investigated issue that requires further studies, especially in the research fields that aim to measure and monitor sustainability of urban practices. The evidence on quantitative approaches to estimate benefits and risks of UPA is less advanced than others. This paper aims to define spatial criteria and indicators to evaluate benefits and possible risks of UPA, using the case study of Turin and its bordering municipalities (Italy). Based on the definition and testing of indicators, embracing a spatial approach, this research aims to verify the feasibility of a set of instruments, to define methods and techniques to collect useful data, to test the replicability and transferability of this approach in other urban contexts, as well as to identify its limitations and gaps. Selected indicators showed a good level of versatility and high potential in order to collect information on UPA and its benefits. Furthermore, results of the application on the case study highlighted a significant growth of UPA benefits, especially profit initiatives and the social and economic domains. Finally, the author outlines policy recommendations to improve the evaluation and monitoring of UPA advantages and risks, as well as a possible trajectory for future research."

We quantified the spatial heterogeneity of six ESs （i.e., water yield, soil retention, water purification, carbon sequestration, habitat quality, and food production） in the Pearl River Delta （PRD） from 2010 to 2022 using the InVEST model and socio-statistical methods. Based on this, the correlation coefficient method, geographically weighted regression model, and self-organizing feature mapping combined with K-means clustering analysis were employed to analyze the spatiotemporal scale effects of the interactions among these six ESs at three spatial scales, namely 1 km2 hexagonal grids, townships, and districts. The results showed that： ① The spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the six ESs in the PRD was significant. Except for soil retention, habitat quality, and food production, the other ESs showed an overall increasing trend over the past 12 years, and the overall spatial distribution pattern of ESs showed a gradient pattern of ""increasing radiation from the central built-up area to the surrounding area."" ② The interactions among paired ESs in the PRD were primarily synergistic, with most of the absolute values of the correlation coefficients reaching their lowest values in 2015. The interactive relationships and strengths between provisioning services and other ESs exhibited obvious scale variability and fluctuation, whereas the significant synergistic relationship between regulating and supporting services was less susceptible to scale changes. ③ Four types of ecosystem service bundles （ESBs） with different functions were identified at both the hexagonal grid, township, and district scales, including three of the same type of ESBs： ecological conservation bundle, agricultural ecology bundle, and urban ecological depletion bundle, along with three different types of ESBs： habitat quality bundle, urban ecological fragility bundle, and urban agricultural maintenance bundle. Transfers between these ESBs exhibited approximately symmetrical evolutionary characteristics over the last 12-year period. The findings can provide scientific references for regional ecological environment governance and ecosystem zoning management."
Comparative Analysis of TAG (Three-Dimensional Architectural Greening) Scenic Beauty Quantitative Techniques Based on Visual Perception,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1aa0a67de43d11a62ef3a91ebeafcdc0e39cc629,Xi Zhou; Ziyang Dong; Fang Zhang,"Three-dimensional architectural greening (TAG) enables the integration of ecological, economic, and social advantages via the effective use of multidimensional space in a variety of forms, making it a significant method for enhancing spatial quality in densely populated cities. TAG technology has expanded the scope and capabilities of urban greening. It has the ability to provide green space, improve urban ecology and aesthetics, and alleviate the conflict between limited land resources and rising demand for greening throughout the urbanization process. Currently, there is a lack of a systematic assessment approach that focuses on the public’s visual perception of TAG. It is critical to focus on advances in visual perception approaches and create a “people-oriented perception driven” evaluation system that serves as a scientific foundation for urban three-dimensional greening initiatives. First, this study created a database of 300 TAG cases and selected classic cases using screening, classification, and sampling. Second, three experiments were set up for the study, including the use of the semantic differential (SD) method, and scenic beauty estimation (SBE) for subjective evaluation, and the eye-tracking experiment for objective evaluation. Finally, this study compared subjective and objective evaluations and demonstrated that both two approaches had a certain amount of accuracy. It also investigated the relationship between spatial features and public visual perceptions using methods such as factor and correlation analysis. The three effective methods for evaluating the quality of TAG based on visual perception that are presented in this study—two subjective and one objective—use standardized images, are quick and simple to use, and make up for the drawbacks of conventional strategies like indirectness, inefficiency, and time-consuming data collection. They also form a solid foundation for the real-world application of categorization prediction. In addition to being adaptable to a wide range of application settings, these two assessment paths—subjective evaluation and objective evaluation—can be integrated to complement one another and provide scientific references for future TAG designs and spatial decision making."

Studies show major Indian cities are rapidly losing green cover in the current decade, which must be arrested with efficient approaches. This is extremely important for maintaining resilience in the urban setting. Cities should be resilient to protect its ecology and residents from the aftermath of major disasters. This resilience can be built by a functioning integrated layout of nature based interventions interlinked with planning. This paper is focused on understanding blue green infrastructure, its approaches, how it has been used in various projects in the country and the world to solve certain relevant environmental issues related to the context.

Ecologies of Anxiety,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ac349f1384282834bc0aeb8d55de50c015e30bb,M. Gauvin,"This paper examines the urban space as an ecology of anxiety in post-9/11 literature. After the atomic bomb drop on Hiroshima in August 1945, survivors testified of experiencing prior to the bombing an anticipatory trauma known as bukimirooted in the belief that a catastrophic event was forthcoming. Paul K. Saint-Amour suggests that similar experiences to bukimi are not exclusive to the residents of Hiroshima but came to structure post-war urban experience as a result of a nuclear condition wrought by the Cold War. My paper explores whether a contemporary bukimi can be identified in post-9/11 literature. The post-9/11 novel—works which directly or indirectly acknowledge the terrorist attacks—present familiar but ambiguous forms of risk engendered by the threat of terrorism and maintained in the form of an urban-originated anxiety. This anxiety is rooted in the spectre of an event that’s never total or conclusive—an event that promises witness testimony and the maintenance of traumatic memories, but which also eclipses calamitous structures (like global warming) that are gradual and continuous. To unravel this contemporary species of bukimi, my paper examines depictions of the urban space in the post-9/11 literature of Foer and McEwan."

Kristanto; Y. D. Apritasari,"Diminishing availability of urban land in metropolitan cities such as Jakarta resulting in high-density settlements, which impacted the quality of life of the urban village communities. One of the government’s efforts to solve this problem is by building subsidized apartments. However, this effort mainly focused on the land scarcity and the required housing aspects, while ecological and environmental roles toward the life quality of the dwellers are often set aside though very influential. On the other hand, Jakarta is very vulnerable to natural disasters related to water, such as flooding caused by stormwater runoff which cannot be accommodated by the insufficient capacity of the surrounding environment. Therefore, the development of urban settlements in Jakarta has to pay more attention to integrate ecology and zero runoff management from the design conception phase. A vertical village residential design in West Jakarta that integrates these two aspects through ecological architecture elements (nature, water, human and environment) was proposed as a role model design for vertical village housing. Various water design features have been creatively designed and integrated into the landscape and building elements resulting in zero runoff and an ecologically significant built environment."

In addition, SUDS may act as hotspots for biodiversity and could be more socially accepted if they work well and are multifunctional. However, we still lack a critical understanding of the techno-ecological basis to construct SUDS sustainably. Due to climate change and pollutants such as de-icing salts, SUDS are confronted with harmful environmental triggers that interfere with their sustainable development. Thus, the challenge is to combine stormwater treatment and urban drainage with principles of restoration ecology, while implementing expertise from soil science, microbiome research, and plant ecology. In this perspective paper, we will discuss the SUDS development and maintenance principle and the role of interdisciplinary research in reaching these goals."

Analysis of the Relationship between National Image Building and International Communication Ability from the Perspective of Ecology under the Media Environment,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1add89ae731561fe15f642a2fe281793a1c2b2a7,Ziyuan Zhu; Chao Zhang,"With the gradual expansion of China's political, economic, and military strength, the rapid rise of China has become a globally recognized fact. At present, although China's international image as the world's second largest economy, military power, and political power has been increasingly accepted by the global community, China's image construction, as an important part of national soft power, is still facing many problems. This chapter focuses on defining the basic concepts of international publicity, China's soft power, and China's image construction in the context of new media integration, analyzes the international development trend of international publicity and the important functions and limitations of foreign publicity in establishing China's image construction, and analyzes the ecological environment of media integration development. Considering that there are great unfairness in the environment and the conflict of communication values is not conducive to the establishment of China's urban image, the article focuses on how to use global publicity values to establish China's national image and puts forward corresponding countermeasures."
Lighting trends reveal state of the dark sky cloak: light at night and its ecological impacts in Aotearoa New Zealand,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1adf4a2f1e874fd82ae729fbb424838ea651e736,E. Cieraad; Bridgette Farnworth,": Artificial light at night (ALAN) exposes many organisms to increased night-time radiance and disrupts natural cycles that have cued the physiology and ecology of plants and animals throughout their evolutionary history. Here, we use satellite data to quantify spatiotemporal trends of ALAN in Aotearoa New Zealand between 2012–2021 and review the literature of the ecological impacts of ALAN. Our results show that the night-time light environment is changing rapidly in Aotearoa New Zealand: while the vast majority (95.2%) of the country had no direct emissions of ALAN, the lit surface area increased by 37.4% (from 3.0% to 4.2%) between 2012 and 2021. A total of 4694 km 2 of the country experienced increased brightness (median increase of 87%) over the decade. In contrast, 886 km 2 became less bright (median decrease 33%), mainly in urban centres where absolute brightness remains high. Our estimated increases in ALAN extent and brightness are underestimates as satellite imagery does not capture sky glow, nor the full extent of the light spectrum emitted by increasingly common light emitting diodes. Impacts of ALAN on the flora and fauna of Aotearoa New Zealand were identified from 39 pieces of literature, with most focussing on behavioural responses in avifauna, mammals, and insects. ALAN is an understudied environmental pollutant, as > 31% of the records described general observations rather than experimental or observational studies and literature describing impacts on groups including herpetofauna and marine mammals was absent"
COST Action Underground4value: Living Labs for the Underground Built Heritage valorisation,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1adfac0ec84011589e52e6008d059cf949ff85be,Giuseppe Pace,"
 <p>Underground4value (COST Action CA18110) is a four years&#8217; project (2019-2023) establishing an expert network from twenty-nine countries, with the objective of promoting balanced and sustainable approaches for the conservation and promotion of underground built heritage (UBH). Every year, four underground sites and their local communities become places for experimenting studies, new policies, and participatory approaches. During the first year (April 2019 - March 2020), the sites of Naples (Italy), La Union (Murcia, Spain), Postojna (Slovenia) and G&#246;reme (Cappadocia, Turkey) have been selected. The originality of the approach is that it is geared towards assisting local communities&#8217; decision-making with cultural, scientific and technical knowledge of the underground built heritage, from many different perspectives: archaeology, geo-technics, history, urban planning, cultural anthropology, economics, architecture, cultural tourism, ecology.</p><p>The Living Lab approach is used to organise fieldwork, spending time on each site with a mix of participants (international scientists and local practitioners). The idea is to identify and explore social innovations models for empowering local communities and making them part of the UBH promotion process. Collected information is then the basis for developing new research and training, which remain open and accessible. Knowledge transfer is secured by several dedicated tasks, including a Training School, held in last February in Naples, where the trainees have morning learning sessions and afternoon research activities on specific topics occurred in the living labs&#8217; activities.</p>

Hegemony and Sustainability. A Call for Historical Materialism,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b19861d3319d67d31c4526a10009eaf1bdba5b8,Sergio D'Agata,"Social scientists have been critical about sustainability from its appearance. However, as the literature on post-politics highlight, they have failed to address why our society endures in unsustainability in what some authors call the post-ecological paradox. This article reflects on some of the major theoretical assumptions of urban political ecology, presenting the urban sustainability fix framework as the most valuable tool to perform a critique of sustainability. It adds to the debate arguing that empirical obstacles are related and rooted in theoretical incompatibility between neo-Marxist and post-structural literatures which shape the discipline, stating the need for a return to historical materialism starting by Antonio Gramsci. To this end, the article proposes to use Jessop’s RSA to analyse sustainable development."

English title: Prevalence of rodents (Muridae and Soricidae) in the dry season in the Commune Urbaine de Kindia 
The choice of this theme would contribute to a better understanding of the ecology of these nearthreatened species, and should enable a sustainable conservation strategy to be put in place. This study on the prevalence of rodents (Muridae and Soricidae) in the dry season  was carried out from November 20, 2021 to May 20, 2022 in inhabited houses, uninhabited houses, stores, agricultural fields, bush-forests  and rice fields in Urban Commune of Kindia. A total of 250 rodents, including 6 species, were captured using tapette-type traps  set in lines of 5 to 10 traps or spaced a few meters apart: 101 (40.40%) Rattus rattus, 89 (35.60%) Mastomys  ssp., 51 (20.40%) Mus  musculus, 4 (1.60%) Praomys ssp., 3 (1.20%) Cricetomys gambianus and 2 (0.80%) Crocidura ssp., 204 (81.60%) were males vs. 46 (18.40%)  females, 39 (15.60%) in the Cacia district versus 4 (1.60%) in the Abattoir district. The largest numbers were caught in inhabited houses  112 (44.80%) versus 10 (4.00%) in bush forests. The traps were baited with dried fish and set from 7pm to 6am before being collected and  taken to the laboratory for identification using the Rosevear method (1969).

Additively Manufactured Urban Multispecies Façades for Building Renovation,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b5ba183c4a60849719d72e4a20f9dab4afdb93a,I. Larikova; Julia Fleckenstein; Ata Chokhachian; T. Auer; W. Weisser; K. Dörfler,"This research investigates the potential of additive manufacturing and digital planning tools for the creation of location-specific façade redesigns that can host cavity-dependent animal species and develops methods for their realization. The proposed approach is explored based on a case study of a student dormitory in need of renovation in the urban area of Munich. Based on theoretical knowledge and design experimentations that link the fields of architecture, climate-responsive design, terrestrial ecology, and digital fabrication, a set of design principles for the additive manufacturing of inhabitable ceramic tiles is conceived and transferred into a computational design tool. The conception of single tiles and the overall façade design are developed in terms of their positive climatic impact on both the animal species and humans, their nesting opportunities, their structural feasibility, and their integrability with standard ceramic façade systems. To verify the fabricability of the proposed design, a façade fragment was additively manufactured as a prototype in 1:1 scale. The initial findings presented in this paper provide a glimpse of how emerging digital technologies could provide new ways to expand current habitual architectural planning and fabrication tools, to enable the creation of site-specific solutions, and to bring together human and animal needs."

Condon,"The Urban Fix: Resilient Cities and the War Against Climate Change is the latest and perhaps penultimate book by esteemed American architect and academic Doug Kelbaugh. His new book attempts to be a sort of owner’s manual for city builders in this crucial age. Kelbaugh, professor and dean emeritus of the Tubman School of Architecture at the University of Michigan, clearly explains the systemic relationships between climate change, population growth, heat island effects, and urban ecology—all in simple but precise language. He equips the reader with enough understanding to discern how city design is both the cause of and the solution for our burgeoning environmental climate change crisis. Solutions presented are both simple and profound, ranging from the overarching urban design principles informing the Islamabad regional plan to guidelines for street tree plantings in North American cities. These are just two of the hopeful and practical solutions in The Urban Fix. In it, Professor Kelbaugh has neatly summarized both the problems of and practical solutions for the nested problems of climate change, population growth, and rapid urbanization. He, correctly in my view, concludes that all of these factors come together in the way cities are designed and function. Kelbaugh expresses his intentions best in the preface when he quotes Plato:"
Integrated framework of rural landscape research: based on the global perspective,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b78b2f6de009e2c959f5a1aff4497e294570fdb,Hualin Xie; Zhenhong Zhu; Yafen He; Xiaoji Zeng; Y. Wen,"In recent years, rural landscapes have played an increasingly important role in the fields of tourism, cultural heritage and ecology. Rural landscape research (RLR), which is characterized by diversity and complexity, has attracted more and more attention from researchers. This study integrated the main research contents of RLR in the past 30 years by arranging the relevant research results and analyzing the research progress of RLR in order to understand the development trend of RLR, the distribution of research power, research hotspots and frontal research. 3740 relevant literatures from 1931 to 2020 were filtrated from the WoS Core Collection Database. Those papers were quantitatively data mined and qualitatively summarized by using Bibliometrics software for mapping and analysis. (1) The number of articles related to RLR increased exponentially over time. The average citations per paper increased fastest from 2002 to 2005. According to the characteristics of the number of articles and the average citations per paper, RLR can be divided into three stages from 1990 to 2020: the first stage is from 1990 to 1999; the second stage is from 2000 to 2008; the third stage is from 2009 to 2020. The second stage of RLR has attracted the most international attention among three stages. (2) According to the results of research strength analysis, Europe has a great influence in RLR. The Common Agricultural Policy and the European Landscape Convention are the main driving forces for the change of rural landscape in Europe. (3) At present, the five hotspots of RLR are rural landscape planning and management, cultural ecosystem services, urban-rural conflict, the sustainable development of rural cultural heritage landscape and the impact of landscape structure on habitat. Rural landscape research was originally developed based on geography and ecology but has now developed to a comprehensive research direction of multidisciplinary and multi-methods with social, economic, culture and other elements. At present, the object of RLR covers the ecological landscape, production landscape, and cultural landscape of rural landscape system; the content of RLR has shifted from static pattern of rural landscape to dynamic evolution process, urban-rural conflict, cultural ecosystem service and multifunctional landscape trade-off; the research paradigm of RLR has changed from single dimension to multi-dimensional, and combined with “3S” technology and various landscape ecological model software. The correlation and mechanism should be studied between the rural landscape multifunctionality based on the perspective of multidisciplinary research and rural landscape system in the future, and carry out dynamic monitoring and trend simulation, so as to clarify the thinking and paths of rural landscape multi-functional trade-off and guide the sustainable development of rural areas."
Grass Gazers: Using citizen science as a tool to facilitate practical and online science learning for secondary school students during the COVID‐19 lockdown,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b804d6d6cb0d9f5d65e75af9bdeb034e0d19ef1,S. Van Haeften; A. Milic; B. Addison-Smith; C. Butcher; J. Davies,"Abstract The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has impacted educational systems worldwide during 2020, including primary and secondary schooling. To enable students of a local secondary school in Brisbane, Queensland, to continue with their practical agricultural science learning and facilitate online learning, a “Grass Gazers” citizen science scoping project was designed and rapidly implemented as a collaboration between the school and a multidisciplinary university research group focused on pollen allergy. Here, we reflect on the process of developing and implementing this project from the perspective of the school and the university. A learning package including modules on pollen identification, tracking grass species, measuring field greenness, using a citizen science data entry platform, forensic palynology, as well as video guides, risk assessment and feedback forms were generated. Junior agriculture science students participated in the learning via online lessons and independent data collection in their own local neighborhood and/or school grounds situated within urban environments. The university research group and school coordinator, operating in their own distributed work environments, had to develop, source, adopt, and/or adapt material rapidly to meet the unique requirements of the project. The experience allowed two‐way knowledge exchange between the secondary and tertiary education sectors. Participating students were introduced to real‐world research and were able to engage in outdoor learning during a time when online, indoor, desk‐based learning dominated their studies. The unique context of restrictions imposed by the social isolation policies, as well as government Public Health and Department of Education directives, allowed the team to respond by adapting teaching and research activity to develop and trial learning modules and citizen science tools. The project provided a focus to motivate and connect teachers, academic staff, and school students during a difficult circumstance. Extension of this citizen project for the purposes of research and secondary school learning has the potential to offer ongoing benefits for grassland ecology data acquisition and student exposure to real‐world science."
Urban political ecology: a critical reconfiguration,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b8cac32564aa06d7c8ab26f54f6a5c0b4ca1a12,M. Gandy,"Urban political ecology now finds itself at a crossroads between gradual marginalization or renewed intellectual impetus. Despite some recent critical re-evaluations of the field, there remain a series of conceptual tensions that have only been partially explored. I consider six issues in particular: the uncertain relations between urban political ecology and the biophysical sciences; the emergence of extended conceptions of agency and subjectivity; the redefinition of space, scale, and the urban realm; renewed interest in urban epidemiology; the delineation of urban ecological imaginaries; and finally, the emergence of evidentiary materialism as an alternative posthuman configuration to new materialist ontologies. I conclude that a conceptually enriched urban political ecology could play an enhanced role in critical environmental research."

The Volga River basin is quite heterogeneous, both in geomorphological and hydrological terms, and in thechnogenical development and usage. A fourrank taxonomy is presented for the selection of sites for monitoring, based on a combination of natural, landscape, climatic and thechnogenical factors. To the largest – the highest taxon – sites of the Ist category – bowls of reservoirs with the slopes and the urban zones, industrial and agricultural structures located within them are carried. Within these areas are allocated to smaller taxa, areas category IInd are the industrial and urban zones, areas category IIIrd are the small rivers without significant contamination and areas category IVth to conduct special observations. The examples of special observations in the study of the annual migration of heavy metals in the system «bottom sediments – water column» on the Ivankovo reservoir are highlighted. The investigations were carried out under the conditions of the standard flow rate for this reservoir and in the conditions of slow water exchange."

Nikolaeva,"The article observes different aspects of the visual ecology in the urban architectural environment and a new public discussion that arose around the anti-acceleration trends (“Slow Architecture”, “Slow Cities”). The theory of the urbanized landscapes visual image’s perception analyzes, from the standpoint of rational aesthetics, critical theory of architecture, topological reflection, and the new ethics of consumption. Philosophical reflection on the phenomenon of slow perception of life, slow activity and the meaning of contemplation is of great importance for the formation of the concept of “slow visual environment”. The hypothesis of the need to limit the iconic forms’ entropy in the visual environment is verified by the examples of objects creating an aggressive landscape and visual pollution. Criteria are offered, defining the visual pollution of urban landscapes, as well as the methods for achieving visual environmental friendliness by slowing down the visual message."
HOW TO GO BEYOND THE WALLS OF THE ACADEMY AND RETURN?,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1baa6dcf0bd8279660b8dad025d234bc97e8b303,P. Fereński,"Город как одно из важнейших явлений современного глобализированного мира является предметом исследования различных научных дисциплин. Это важный феномен для изучения истории цивилизации, процессов урбанизации, развития архитектуры, взаимоотношений между пространственным планированием и религиозными и политическими идеями, для исследования социальных и экономических изменений, городского образа жизни, истории искусства, а также для критики современного искусства. Элементарный анализ города присутствует также в области литературоведения, исследований звука и перформанса, психологии (восприятие пространства и его свойств), педагогики, политологии (с интересом к теме прямой демократии или же городских движений). Вопросы оптимизации моделей функционирования города важны для департаментов, ориентированных на транспорт и инфраструктуру (водоснабжение, газ и т. д.), а также подземное строительство (автостоянки, гаражи, тоннели, метро). В проектировании «умного города» участвуют и информатика, занимающаяся процессом создания новых коммуникационных технологий, и факультеты биологии или охраны окружающей среды, которые ведут исследовательскую и дидактическую деятельность в области «прикладной экологии» – отношений, возникающих между средой, непосредственно окружающей человека, и природой. Сегодня технологические инновации и творческая сила культуры являются ключом к развитию города. Однако что это значит для представителей гуманитарных наук? Какую пользу они могут принести в этой области? Городское пространство может быть показано ими как неоднородное место, полное постоянной напряжённости, столкновений, круговорота значений, ценностей, представлений, а также как область значительных социальных экспериментов. Я воспринимаю человеческие практики и человеческое творчество как то, что постоянно подвергается трансформации и постоянно требует новых прочтений. В своих поисках я часто выхожу за стены Академии и пытаюсь ощутить характер города, ощутить его пространство всеми своими чувствами. Я непосредственно наблюдаю образ жизни жителей, их повседневные практики. Я слушаю, что они говорят, и читаю, что они выражают на стенах домов. Это своеобразное блуждание по городу имеет целью запечатлеть то, что видно, а также то, что остаётся для нас на первый взгляд недоступным. Это собрание заметок, попытка визуальной и аудиозаписи окружающего мира, которые я затем пытаюсь структурировать и интерпретировать. Однако нам, академикам, нужно как экспертам «выходить» в город и по-другому – мы должны выступать в общественных дебатах и влиять на решения различных муниципальных учреждений, оказывать влияние на местную политику. Такова и дискуссия о роли университета в формировании городского пространства и жизни в городе.The city as one of the most important phenomena of the modern globalized world is the subject of investigations of various scientific disciplines. It is important phenomena for studies on the history of civilization, on urbanization processes, on the development of architecture, on the relationships between spatial planning and religious and political ideas, for studies on social and economic changes, for studies on urban ways of life, studies on the history of art, as well as critique of contemporary art. There are also elementary analyzes of a city in the field of literary studies, sound studies, performance studies, psychology (the perception of space and its properties), pedagogy, political science (interested in direct democracy or even urban movements). The issues of optimization of models of the city’s functioning are important for departments oriented on transport and infrastructure (water, gas etc.), as well as underground construction (car parks, garages, tunnels, metro). Informatics dealing with the process of creation of new communication technologies is involved in the design of “smart city”. The faculties of biology or environmental protection conduct research and didactic activities in the field of “applied ecology” – relations that occurring between the human environment and nature. Today technological innovation and creative power of culture are the key to the development of the city. However, what does it mean for the representatives of humanities? What can they bring to it? The city space then appears as a heterogeneous place, full of constant tensions, collisions, circulation of meanings, values, representations, as well as the field of great social experiments. I perceive the human practices and creations as something that is a subject to constant transformation and that constantly requires new readings. In my search, I often go beyond the walls of the academy and try to sense the character of the city and experience its space with all my senses. I keenly observe the ways of life of the inhabitants, their daily practices. I listen to what they say and read what they manifest on the walls of buildings. This peculiar wandering around the city is aimed at capturing what is visible, but also at reaching what remains inaccessible to us at first glance. It is a collection of notes, it is an attempt at visual and audio recording of the surrounding world, which I then try to structure and interpret. However, as experts, we academics need to “go out” to the city also in a different way – we must take the floor in public debates and have an influence on the decisions of various municipal institutions, have an impact on local politics. There is a discussion about the role of the university in shaping urban space and life in the city."
Usage of ZigBee and LoRa wireless technologies in IoT systems,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1baecfe6bb3c90adf76c26d163d3e13e9afcaa3b,Vlad-Dacian Gavra; O. Pop,"IoT systems are based sensors and actuators to enable ubiquitous sensing to measure environment parameters from delicate ecologies and natural environments to urban environments. By connecting these sensors and actuators to a big network, like internet, an automatization can be performed, and repetitive actions can be done in background by the IoT ecosystem and save a lot of time. IoT can do such things in Home Automation, Smart Cities and even in Air Quality analysis. IoT solution are dependent on the way sensors are transmitting data to cloud or up to the internet. This paper will present the benefits of using Zig Bee instead of using traditional Wi-Fi sensor and present some of the characteristics of LoRa sensors. Cloud computing contributed to the expansion of the IoT systems by offloading local IoT devices of computation intensive tasks. Fog computing brings Cloud closer to the sensors and by doing this minimize communication latencies."

McPhearson; Steward T A Pickett,"This paper positions urban ecology as increasingly conversant with multiple perspectives and methods for understanding the functions and qualities of diverse cities and urban situations. Despite progress in the field, we need clear pathways for positioning, connecting and synthesising specific knowledge and to make it speak to more systemic questions about cities and the life within them. These pathways need to be able to make use of diverse sources of information to better account for the diverse relations between people, other species and the ecological, social, cultural, economic, technical and increasingly digital structures that they are embedded in. Grounded in a description of the systemic knowledge needed, we propose five complementary and often connected approaches for building cumulative systemic understandings, and a framework for connecting and combining different methods and evidence. The approaches and the framework help position urban ecology and other fields of study as entry points to further advance interdisciplinary synthesis and open up new fields of research."

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMART CITIES IN UKRAINE IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL TRENDS,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c10f3f2ccf3f08e5dd89d5a528dfc7db837f72a,I. Uninets,"The article analyzes the features of the modern stage of the development of smart cities in the world and in Ukraine, and highlights the key prerequisites. It has been established that the formation of smart cities takes place in the conditions of global intellectualization, which is reflected in the key indexes and ratings of smart city evaluation in the world. It was determined that the weight of intellectualization factors in individual indices can reach 40% in the overall assessment. In general, within the framework of the study, the Ukrainian case of the formation of smart cities was characterized and the key forms of implementation of the smartization process of city management were analyzed. The key features of the formation of a smart management system in the cities of Kyiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Odesa, Lviv, and Dnipro have been determined. It has been determined that at the initial stage, capital investment in the development of smart cities is key to the formation of an integrated system of smart management, which combines the need to create prerequisites for high-quality well-being, increase the competitiveness of cities and ensure sustainability. In general, the key goal of the development of smart cities involves optimizing the function of megacities, increasing the level of comfort for living in all constituent elements, including government, society, economy, ecology, lifestyle and mobility opportunities. Today’s urban environment is filled with advanced multimodal transportation systems, self-sustaining and self-managing energy networks, comprehensive services, amenities, and access to services. However, complex problems complicate the implementation of the concept of smart cities, which includes infrastructure support, the growth of the urban population and the need to implement the global goals of sustainable development. The construction of a smart city system is possible only under the condition of unification and joint work of authorities, businesses and public organizations, which is caused by the need to combine all management systems into a single network."

Foley,"An outbreak of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) transmitted by the brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato) has emerged as a major human and animal health concern in Mexicali, Mexico. Due to high rates of brown dog tick infestation, susceptibility, and association with humans, dogs serve as sentinels and have a key role in the ecology of RMSF. A cross-sectional household questionnaire study was conducted in six rural and urban locations to characterize dog ecology and demography in RMSF high-and low-risk areas of Mexicali. In addition, we tracked movement patterns of 16 dogs using a GPS data logger. Of 253 households, 73% owned dogs, and dog ownership tended to be higher in high-risk areas, with a mean dog:human ratio of 0.43, compared with 0.3 in low-risk areas. Dogs in high-risk areas had higher fecundity and roamed more, but the dog density and numbers of free-roaming dogs were comparable. There was a higher proportion of younger dogs and lower proportion of older dogs in high-risk areas. The high proportion of immunologically naïve puppies in high risk areas could result in a lack of herd immunity leading to a more vulnerable dog and human population. The marked increase of space use of free-roaming dogs in high-risk areas suggests that unrestrained dogs could play an important role in spreading ticks and pathogens. As means to limit RMSF risk, practical changes could include increased efforts for spay-neuter and policies encouraging dog restraint to limit canine roaming and spread of ticks across communities; due to dog density is less impactful such policies may be more useful than restrictions on the number of owned dogs."
Habitat selection of non‐breeding American black ducks in an urban estuary,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c36aedfbba2f4821a28ed15cc9add06348d39f7,Tori Mezebish Quinn; P. W. Paton; B. Gerber; Jennifer E. Kilburn; Scott R. McWilliams,"Shellfish aquaculture is a globally expanding industry, including in urban estuaries that support non‐breeding waterfowl. The effects of shellfish aquaculture on the spatial distribution of non‐breeding waterfowl, however, are poorly understood and depend on the ecology of waterfowl and cultivated shellfish species. We investigated how proximity to shellfish aquaculture influenced habitat selection and movement patterns of American black ducks (Anas rubripes) during the non‐breeding season (~Oct–May) in 2020–2023 in Rhode Island, USA. The extent to which proximity to aquaculture influenced habitat selection of black ducks depended on factors specific to individuals' primary non‐breeding sites, although proximity to aquaculture did not have biologically meaningful influences on black duck movement rates across all sites. Black ducks across sites consistently selected for areas better suited for aquaculture (i.e., areas of potential future development) relative to areas poorly suited for aquaculture (i.e., areas less likely to be developed). The continued expansion of aquaculture into preferred black duck habitats will increase black duck interactions with aquaculture and therefore should be considered in the decision‐making process for siting future aquaculture leases. Future studies should quantify the extent to which continued expansion of aquaculture in those preferred coastal habitats directly influences black ducks."
Main directions for the formation and development of the “green” nature management in Tajikistan,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c3978ca6abf0e6c1945edea7430426d38012aa4,R. H. Isaynov; F. Arabov; K. Sodikov; Kh R Bobohonzoda; K. R. Asomuddin; R. A. Israilova,"The article summarizes the ways of forming a “green nature management” and its prospective development in the republic. The theoretical aspects of the formation of a green nature management are considered. It is noted that the foundations for the formation of the concept of a green nature management were laid within the framework of the concept of sustainable development back in the late 80s of the last century. According to the definition of scientists, sustainable development includes three dimensions - economic, social and environmental. Only by observing the requirements of sustainability in relation to each of these dimensions can sustainable development as a whole be achieved. Confirmation that the issues of formation and development of the “green nature management” concern, among other things, Tajikistan, is the active sup-port of international cooperation and a constant participant in processes in the field of water problems, ecology and sustainable development at the global, regional and national levels. ... The article notes that in the republic, 98% of electricity production is accounted for by hydropower, which is considered “green” energy and is a valuable contribution of Tajikistan in solving global environmental problems. The article studies the world experience in the development of the “green nature management” and it shows that at present in various countries of the world efforts are being made to develop the “green nature management” and the introduction of its constituent elements, such as: increasing the share of environmentally friendly and renewable energy sources: hydropower, wind, solar, biogas and biofuels. In general, analyzing the ways of formation and development trends of the “green nature management”, the article proposes the main priority sectors of the national economy, in which in the future it will be possible to attract investment both from internal sources (from the budget of the republic) and foreign investments (foreign investments): energy, industrial production, transport, tourism, agriculture and urban economy."

Khabaz,"of the Polish conceptualist J. Kozakiewicz, whose work and theoretical works are little known to the Ukrainian artistic community. However, his theoretical and practical work can be basic for use and reinterpretation by Ukrainian artists and researchers. In his concepts, Kozakiewicz questions the anthropometric nature of the Vitruvian man as a traditional paradigm of architecture, reveals an analogy between the human body and the natural world, and proposes an organic paradigm. The article reveals the artist’s thoughts about his visual projects and non-architectural structures that people often consider ""impossible"". Offered a brief analysis of the artist’s works, created at the intersection of art, science and architecture, is provided. The authors investigate the artistic architectural project ""Mars"", which is an artistic project of rejuvenating the earth, a giant auricle overgrown with grass. The latest works and exhibitions of J. Kozakiewich are also analyzed using specific examples. So, the article primarily focuses on the work of J. Kozakiewicz in an attempt to find a balance between urban life, architecture and ecology. This search led him to utopian architectural and environmental art projects that aim to create a group discussion within the architectural and environmental spheres. It is through the efforts of such conceptualists as Ya. Kozakevych that the future art is born, in which there will be no clear division between its various types and the main feature of which will be the ability to reflect the human essence in the most diverse forms."

An ecological security pattern can effectively control urban expansion, and it is of great significance to balance urban development and ecological protection. In order to analyze the impact of ecological security patterns on urban expansion, Hangzhou was taken as an example, the CA-Markov model and FLUS model were used to simulate the urban expansion pattern in 2030 under the natural development scenario and the ecological security scenario. The results showed that (1) the ecological source area in the study area is 630.90 km2 and was mainly distributed in the western mountainous area. There are 14 ecological corridors, primarily composed of valleys and rivers. Ecological nodes are mainly distributed on the north and south sides of the main urban area. (2) From 2000 to 2018, the annual increase index (AI) of construction land decreased in the northeast and southeast directions but increased in the northwest and southwest directions, and in the northeast direction the value was always the highest. Except for the southwest direction, the average annual growth rate (AGR) of construction land in the other directions decreased. At a distance from the city center of 30 km, AI was relatively higher and was increasing, while AGR was declining. At a distance of 30–45 km, both AI and AGR were increasing, indicating that the focus of construction land was moving outwards. (3) From 2018 to 2030, under both natural development scenario and ecological security scenario, construction land would keep expanding, but the construction land area, proportion, AI, and AGR of the latter would both be smaller than the former, indicating that the ecological security pattern can effectively curb urban expansion. Because of a large amount area of ecological sources, the expansion of construction land in the southwest direction would be constrained, especially under the ecological security scenario. The methods and results of this study can provide theoretical and application references for urban planning and green development in metropolises."

All containers with water were examined for Aedes mosquitoes at 150 locations, including residential properties, a plant nursery, junkyards, and recreational parks and playgrounds. A total of 103 larvae, 37 pupae, 5 female and 2 male Ae. vittatus were collected from a fountain. This was the first detection of Ae. vittatus in urban Islamabad. Additional vector surveillance is needed to better understand the geographical distribution, ecology, and behavior of this invasive species and to understand its possible role in the transmission of dengue and chikungunya viruses in Pakistan."

Urban areas are foci for the introduction of non‐native plant species, and they often act as launching sites for invasions into the wider environment. Although interest in biological invasions in urban areas is growing rapidly, and the extent and complexity of problems associated with invasions in these systems have increased, data on the composition and numbers of non‐native plants in urbanized areas remain scattered and idiosyncratic.

We assembled data from multiple sources to create the Global Urban Biological Invasions Compendium (GUBIC) for vascular plants representing 553 urban centres from 61 countries across every continent except Antarctica.

The GUBIC repository includes 8140 non‐native plant species from 253 families. The number of urban centres in which these non‐native species occurred had a log‐normal distribution, with 65.2% of non‐native species occurring in fewer than 10 urban centres.

Practical implications: The dataset has wider applications for urban ecology, invasion biology, macroecology, conservation, urban planning and sustainability. We hope this dataset will stimulate future research in invasion ecology related to the diversity and distributional patterns of non‐native flora across urban centres worldwide. Further, this information should aid the early detection and risk assessment of potential invasive species, inform policy development and assist in setting management priorities.

Microbiome response in an urban river system is dominated by seasonality over wastewater treatment upgrades,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ca47b446d45e0511a5cb433bb965c93360fe939,Shogo Kodera; Anukriti Sharma; C. Martino; M. Dsouza; Mark A. Grippo; H. Lutz; R. Knight; J. Gilbert; C. Negri; S. Allard,"Background Microorganisms such as coliform-forming bacteria are commonly used to assess freshwater quality for drinking and recreational use. However, such organisms do not exist in isolation; they exist within the context of dynamic, interactive microbial communities which vary through space and time. Elucidating spatiotemporal microbial dynamics is imperative for discriminating robust community changes from ephemeral ecological trends, and for improving our overall understanding of the relationship between microbial communities and ecosystem health. We conducted a seven-year (2013–2019) microbial time-series investigation in the Chicago Area Waterways (CAWS): an urban river system which, in 2016, experienced substantial upgrades to disinfection processes at two wastewater reclamation plants (WRPs) that discharge into the CAWS and improved stormwater capture, to improve river water quality and reduce flooding. Using culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches, we compared CAWS microbial ecology before and after the intervention. Results Examinations of time-resolved beta distances between WRP-adjacent sites showed that community similarity measures were often consistent with the spatial orientation of site locations to one another and to the WRP outfalls. Fecal coliform results suggested that upgrades reduced coliform-associated bacteria in the effluent and the downstream river community. However, examinations of whole community changes through time suggest that the upgrades did little to affect overall riverine community dynamics, which instead were overwhelmingly driven by yearly patterns consistent with seasonality. Conclusions This study presents a systematic effort to combine 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with traditional culture-based methods to evaluate the influence of treatment innovations and systems upgrades on the microbiome of the Chicago Area Waterway System, representing the longest and most comprehensive characterization of the microbiome of an urban waterway yet attempted. We found that the systems upgrades were successful in improving specific water quality measures immediately downstream of wastewater outflows. Additionally, we found that the implementation of the water quality improvement measures to the river system did not disrupt the overall dynamics of the downstream microbial community, which remained heavily influenced by seasonal trends. Such results emphasize the dynamic nature of microbiomes in open environmental systems such as the CAWS, but also suggest that the seasonal oscillations remain consistent even when perturbed."

A survey-based study on wildlife was conducted for three years from March 2017 to February 2020 in Dhaka University campus. Data was collected through direct visual encounter observations. A total of 94 species of wildlife under 20 orders and 52 families were observed. Of the documented wildlife, 5 (5.32%) species belongs to amphibians, 10 (10.64%) reptiles, 70 (74.47%) birds and 9 (9.57%) mammals. The highest species richness (72, 76.60%) was observed in the third year (March 2019 to February 2020), particularly in winter season. Although the lowest richness was (63, 67.02%) found in the first year (March 2017 to February 2018), but the evenness was the highest this year, particularly in summer season. We counted the highest number of individuals (n=5227, 35.73%) in the first year (March 2017 to February 2018) but these counts have gradually decreased with the lowest in the third year (March 2019 to February 2020). Among 94 species, 44 species (46.80%) were very common, 3 (3.19%) common, 17(18.09%) uncommon and 30 (31.91%) were few. Duttaphrynus melanostictus was the most abundant (66.89%) among amphibians, Hemidactylus frenatus (40.82%) for reptiles, Psittacula krameri (18.73%) for birds and Mus musculus (28.68%) for mammals. Rampant human movements and sound pollution were frequent inside the campus that might affect wildlife. Therefore, long-term systematic monitoring is necessary to understand the species diversity and population trend of wildlife in the campus. Moreover, this baseline information may help urban policymakers to take proper management measures for the protection of wildlife in the study area.

In the information age, public online search is a typical behavior of Internet society, which is the key to information flow generation and agglomeration. In this study, we attempt to explore the evolutionary characteristics of intercity networks driven by public online social behavior in the information age and construct an information flow network (IFN) from the perspective of public search attention. We also explore the evolution of the IFN in terms of the whole network, node hierarchy, and subgroup aggregation. Meanwhile, we also discuss the impact of the sustainable driving factors on the IFN. Finally, an empirical study was conducted in Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration (GPUA). Our results show that: (1) the information flow in GPUA fluctuating upward in the early study period and gradually decreasing in the later study period. However, the agglomeration degree of information flow in the urban agglomeration continues to increase. (2) The hierarchical structure of urban nodes in GPUA presents a trend of “high in the middle and low on both sides”, and the formation of subgroups is closely related to geographic location. (3) The driving factors all impacting the IFN include public ecology, resource investment, information infrastructure, and economic foundation. This study provides theoretical and practical support for exploring the intercity network and promotes the sustainable urban development."

Among mammalian predators, the red fox Vulpes vulpes is a widespread, opportunistic forager: its diet has been largely studied, outlining wide variation according to geographic and climatic factors. We aimed to check if, throughout the species’ European range, diets vary widely in macronutrient composition or foxes can combine complementary foods to gain the same nutrient intake. First, we assessed fox’s intake target in the framework of nutritional geometry. Secondly, we aimed to highlight the effects of unbalanced diets on fox density, which was assumed as a proxy for Darwinian fitness, as assessed in five areas of the western Italian Alps. Unexpectedly, the target macronutrient ratio of the fox (52.4% protein-, 38.7% lipid- and 8.9% carbohydrate energy) was consistent with that of hypercarnivores, such as wolves and felids, except for carbohydrate intakes in urban and rural habitats. The inverse relation between density and the deviation of observed macronutrient ratios from the intake target suggests that fox capability of surviving in a wide range of habitats may not be exempt from fitness costs and that nutrient availability should be regarded among the biotic factors affecting animal abundance and distribution."

This study reports the first successful urban nesting of the Grey Heron in South Kerala, India. Observations were carried out at Ashtamudi Lake, recognized as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, where a pair successfully raised three fledglings on a Samanea saman tree in a busy urban setting. This breeding event, which occurred outside the conventional monsoon season and in an urbanized area, emphasizes the species' adaptability and potential for successful synurbanization. The findings offer insights into the breeding ecology of the Grey Heron, its nesting behaviors in urban environments, and its resilience in the context of human-induced changes."
Coupling coordination analysis between urban park wetland water ecological construction and carbon emissions,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1cc279b431d2e5907984a7b95e8796583dd89578,Dexin Huang,"The low-carbon design of wetland park landscape is very important to maintain the water balance and carbon balance of human and ecosystem. The combination of an increase in carbon emissions and a decrease in carbon capture increases net carbon emissions. Based on the coupling and coordination analysis between water ecological construction and carbon emission of urban park wet-land ecological landscape, this study constructed a carbon-water (CW) coupling simulation model of urban park wetland ecological landscape, proposed a low-carbon urban park wetland water ecological model, and then analyzed the coupling effect of carbon and water and carbon emission prediction of urban park wetland. The above method is supported by the recognition technology of CW coupling mechanism of urban park wetland and the reasonable allocation technology of water resources based on low-carbon model, and the technical innovation is realized in these two aspects. Finally, the low-carbon water resource allocation plan of urban park wetland is discussed. The results show that economic development and energy consumption will be developed according to the extended or low-carbon model, and the agricultural and forestry irrigation quota will be reduced by 0.01~0.02 mm and 10,000 m 3 / ha, respectively. The irrigation water utilization coefficient, the water consumption rate of canal system and channel system were increased to 0.74 and 0.85 respectively.

Lion City Zoopolis: Urban Crittizenship in Biophilic Singapore,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1cdc89fec25a9bc373d089fbbf88d07adad7ba57,George Wong,"ABSTRACT A central theme of Singapore’s “City in Nature” vision is framed through biophilic urbanism, or efforts to harmonize biodiversity and urban development through built, social, and political design. The central discourses of Singapore’s biophilic urbanism have revolved around flora-centric paradigms, including habitat conservation, greening spaces, and access to natural capital. This paper detours from conventions of Singapore’s urban ecological futures and instead explores the governance of fauna co-existence in the city–state through the concept of “urban crittizenship.” Defined as a more-than-human denization framework that interrogates urban wildlife governance, urban crittizenship interrogates the politics of urban wildlife’s rights to the city. Drawing on interviews, publicly accessible data, and ethnographic findings with local governing actors and activists, I show that Singapore’s experience of urban fauna governance is framed through three categories (“resident,” “wildlife,” and “pest”) and that they inform how state and society mediate and manage coexistence with urban wildlife. These experiences are examined through the examples of otters, boars, and pigeons, respectively. In doing so, I present urban crittizenship as an inductive model of analyzing urban wildlife coexistence as primarily secured through infrastructural and political regime configurations that inform their crittizenship statuses. Any real shifts toward new forms of coexistence must therefore begin with actual transformations in these areas. I further iterate that using an urban crittizenship framework refines our understanding and application of biophilic urbanism as socio-political processes that influence already-existing urban wildlife coexistence, complementing existing analyses in urban ecology. In other words, there is a politics of biophilia that warrants a conversation, because biophilia is political."
Street-level green spaces support a key urban population of the threatened Hispaniolan parakeet Psittacara chloropterus,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1cf83f17ab699c0f7e58020a741411253ed89289,M. Geary; Celia J. Brailsford; Laura I. Hough; Fraser Baker; Simón A. Guerrero; Y. León; N. Collar; S. Marsden,"While urbanisation remains a major threat to biodiversity, urban areas can sometimes play an important role in protecting threatened species, especially exploited taxa such as parrots. The Hispaniolan Parakeet Psittacara chloropterus has been extirpated across much of Hispaniola, including from most protected areas, yet Santo Domingo (capital city of the Dominican Republic) has recently been found to support the island’s densest remaining population. In 2019, we used repeated transects and point-counts across 60 1 km2 squares of Santo Domingo to examine the distribution of parakeets, identify factors that might drive local presence and abundance, and investigate breeding ecology. Occupancy models indicate that parakeet presence was positively related to tree species richness across the city. N-Mixture models show parakeet encounter rates were correlated positively with species richness of trees and number of discrete ‘green’ patches (> 100 m2) within the survey squares. Hispaniolan Woodpecker Melanerpes striatus, the main tree-cavity-producing species on Hispaniola, occurs throughout the city, but few parakeet nests are known to involve the secondary use of its or other cavities in trees/palms. Most parakeet breeding (perhaps 50–100 pairs) appears to occur at two colonies in old buildings, and possibly only a small proportion of the city’s 1500+ parakeets that occupy a single roost in street trees breed in any year. Our models emphasise the importance of parks and gardens in providing feeding resources for this IUCN Vulnerable species. Hispaniola’s urban centres may be strongholds for populations of parakeets and may even represent sources for birds to recolonise formerly occupied areas on the island."

Environmental Microsegregation: Urban Renewal and the Political Ecology of Health,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d1a7897cce64d3da8e8f30db053fe07915ab1b0,Klaus Geiselhart; David Spenger,"In recent years, multiple-burden maps were developed as a tool for assessing environmental health inequities in cities. Maps of this kind are particularly useful in identifying disadvantaged neighbourhoods. In the case of Erlangen (Germany), the historical development of poorer neighbourhoods may mean that their situation as regards environmental assets is relatively favourable. However, urban renewal often precipitates the redistribution of environmental “goods” and “bads” in such a way as to place a disproportionate burden on socio-economically deprived people and privilege the better-off. This type of environmental microsegregation occurs on a scale below that of neighbourhoods, which means that newly developed approaches in urban geography may fail to identify it.

Romanchuk; Oleh Romanchuk,"Today, we are more likely to speak and write about the more progressive destruction of land biosphere as a result of irrational economic activities of mankind – the replacement of traditional natural ecosystems by anthropogenic systems (techno-, urban- and agro-systems), discuss the harmonization of the interaction of society and nature, talk about growing socio-political tension and instability on the planet. However, it is not just about understanding the effects of environmental civilization, but also awareness of the psychological and socioeconomic consequences of the brutal destruction of the biosphere, finding ways and means of solving the tasks associated with the ecological crisis, which has already entered the geopolitical level – during the last years there is carried out an intensive research on the effects of the crisis in the biosphere on the system of national interests and state security. The war waged by the Russian Federation against Ukraine is causing serious environmental damage to the Ukrainian state. Combat operations spoil the air, pollute water bodies, destroy forests and unique ecosystems, destroy crops and, in the long run, can cause colossal damage to the ecosystem of the whole Eastern Europe, and shorten the lives of Ukrainians. Key words: biosphere, ecosystem, evolution, ecology, civilization, the Russian-Ukrainian war, safety, problem, ecology."
"Making rent: how forced migrant families access private rental housing in the Biqa’ Valley, Lebanon",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d1c1646681a96afbdf4e810694116dfaa6aacde,Hannah Sender,"The private rental market is a key provider of housing to forced migrants. This paper examines qualitative data from case study research in rapidly urbanizing towns in the Biqa’ Valley, Lebanon, focusing on Syrian forced migrants’ efforts to access housing through the local private rental sector. Building on literature about landlord–tenant relations and anthropological work on kin, I argue that rental agreements ought to be understood as both financial and social arrangements, which involve family members, landlords and middlemen (shaweesh) in complex rental ecologies. I find that young Syrians are caught up in evolving financial and social obligations, which make inhabitation possible, but which perpetuate gendered and xenophobic forms of dispossession. I argue that humanitarian and development actors advocating for the right of forced migrants to settle in urban areas ought to avoid perpetuating reliance on an inequitable private rental sector."
Operation Mechanism and Evaluation of “County High School Education Model” in the Context of Chinese College Entrance Examination System,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d24b66c6cd26edc35ae3319dcd34499f24d4a13,Jiagan Huang,"The “county high school phenomenon” of Chinese rural high school education to pursue higher education has attracted much attention from the education field and society. Earlier studies were mostly from the perspective of education and believed that the “county high school education model” was contrary to education’s essence because it emphasized test-oriented education and restrained students’ nature and should be discarded. However, this model is surprisingly persuasive for rural families, and it is also a reflection of the rural students’ desire to achieve upward mobility through education. This paper analyzed the county high school education model’s connotation, expounded its operating mechanism, and systematically demonstrated and analyzed the “county high school education model” from multiple angles. It aims to find a way out for the future development of the “county high school education model” to promote education equity between urban and rural areas and the harmonious development of high school education ecology."

What place does nature occupy in Henri Lefebvre’s theory of the production of space? A few thoughts,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d2bf65eeba5cb24cda01385007cb066c09f54f2,Cláudio Smalley Soares Pereira,"It is of particular note how, over recent decades, the theory of the production of space, drawn up in the 1970s by Henri Lefebvre, has become one of the leading approaches to urban studies. Although his contributions are still applied today in manifold interpretations in both the Global North and South, there are nonetheless a myriad of interrelated themes to Lefebvrian theorization that deserve greater attention. In this paper, I propose to problematize the relationship between the theory of the production of space and ecology under the assumption that within Lefebvre’s theory there is a concept of nature, which is fundamental to understanding the politics of spatial policy and therefore, enables the politicization of nature and ecology to be perceived. The hypothesis I develop in this article is a first approach to the subject of Nature in the works of Lefebvre, seeking to link the threads which connect the discussion on the Theory of the Production of Space, and the conception of nature related to that theory."
Conditions for the Reproduction of Human Capital in a Sustainable City on the Example of Krasnodar,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d3c118f7d3a9944b97bbf98424b72e6d863a5ae,E. Chernenko; I. Lebedeva; V. Kupina,"Ideally, a sustainable city creates a sustainable lifestyle in four areas: ecology, economics, politics and culture. The relationship between lifestyle and health is most fully expressed in the concept of ""healthy lifestyle"" - it is a prerequisite for the development of various aspects of human life, the achievement of active longevity and the full performance of social functions. The integrated development of facilities that form the social infrastructure of the city, their accessibility and effective functioning play an important role in improving the level and quality of life of the population. This is very important for Krasnodar as one of the fastest growing cities with a million-plus population. The working-age population is 58.7%, it is distributed in four intra-city districts extremely unevenly, more than 8% of the population lives in rural settlements that are part of the Krasnodar municipality. The rapid growth of the city's population, on the one hand, creates an increased burden on the social infrastructure, and on the other hand, it is the key to the successful socio-economic development of the city. Krasnodar belongs to the category “City with a favorable urban environment”. However, there remains an urgent need for preschool and secondary education organizations, as well as medical organizations. One of the ways to solve these problems is Krasnodar's entry into the Healthy Cities network. Urban health initiatives, developed under the auspices of WHO, are driving change to create urban health and urban environments that will help improve the health and well-being of people."

Genetic analysis tools to investigate the role of wildlife in disease transmission in modified environments,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d59a1d092259c161b2866fbd8b4cc7a1ff60084,T. Proboste,"The availability of cost and time-efficient tools for investigating wildlife disease and vector ecology is extremely important in a changing landscape with urbanisation affecting dispersal and ecology of wildlife populations and disease-carrying vectors. It is important also as the majority of zoonotic outbreaks (transmittable from animal to human populations) have originated in wildlife. Genetic tools and spatially explicit models can be used to study vector-borne diseases ecology and vector-host interactions and hence the transmission of diseases-causing pathogens that require a vector to spread among hosts. Tools such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) allow the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples and are becoming a cost-efficient way to collect extensive amounts of data to address complex questions. Despite the new opportunities that developments in molecular techniques are providing in disease ecology, there is a need for studies that critically evaluate their applicability, benefits and limitations, and to explore the new opportunities that genomic tools can provide.The overall objective of this thesis was to develop and test several novel molecular tools to provide new opportunities in the investigation of disease transmission and vector ecology in wildlife populations. I evaluated the potential applications of three genetic methodological developments to disease ecology: i) using symbiont genetic profiles to estimate host contact networks using eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) as a model, ii) evaluating potential landscape barriers to paralysis tick (Ixodes holocyclus) dispersal using the ddRADseq (double-digestion restriction site-associated DNA sequencing) method, iii) evaluating the barcoding and the ddRADseq approaches for blood meal analysis in paralysis ticks and to detect the presence of pathogens. In addition, I supplemented my landscape genetics and blood meal analyses by creating much needed species distribution models to predict paralysis tick occurrence at a local-scale (Brisbane) and at a state-scale (Queensland, Australia).Estimating contact networks and hence disease transmission can be difficult in wildlife populations. Patterns of commensal bacterial genotype sharing tested as a predictor of hosts’ social associations, as both should indicate levels of contact, and tested as a feasible proxy for estimating potential transmission networks. Escherichia coli was cultured from 132 eastern grey kangaroo faecal samples, and BOX-PCR was used to obtain bacterial genotypes to construct the bacterial network. Escherichia coli was cultured from 94 kangaroo faecal samples (71% prevalence). The threshold to determine host association and the similarity cut-off value used to define E. coli genotypes had important ramifications for inferring links between individuals. Opposite patterns were found based on the chosen threshold. I found that sharing commensal bacterial genotype might not be an efficient method to estimate contact between individuals since the results were strongly related to user-defined parameters for constructing the networks.Landscape genetic tools have increased the opportunities for identifying variables that influence pathogen spread; however, they have been underutilised in investigating vector-borne diseases dispersal. The capability of the ddRADseq was evaluated to determine the genetic population structure of an important disease vector in Queensland, Australia; the paralysis tick. A total of 20,772 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified among 34 individual paralysis ticks. Using population genomic analyses, K=2 was the best fitting model for the admixture analysis. Evidence for both isolation by distance and isolation by resistance based on foliage projective cover and population density factors was found, with a main highway identified as a probable barrier between the two genetic clusters. However, the pairwise genetic distance was explained better by the geographical distance than by the resistance surface, which suggests that paralysis tick hosts are probably urban-adapted species with a small habitat range.Host abundance and host diversity changes across urban environments are expected to influence the host preferences of ticks. Host preferences have been studied based on host trapping, but this can result in sampling bias. The capability of the barcoding DNA method and the ddRADseq approach were evaluated for efficacy in detecting the host species used by paralysis ticks. The ddRADseq method provides short reads from a reduced representation sample of the genome, and these were compared to host and pathogen mitochondrial libraries. DNA was extracted from the whole adult tick to identify blood meal hosts from nymph stage. The ddRADseq method and a more conventional barcoding approach were able to detect previous host DNA. Host DNA was detected in four (12%) of the ticks using the barcoding approach, and in two ticks and four fed adult ticks included as controls using the ddRADseq approach. Pathogen DNA of Ehrlichia canis and Rickettsia australis were detected using the ddRADseq approach.Understanding the distribution of pathogens and vectors is important for predicting and managing their potential impacts on people. However, estimating these distributions quantitatively is difficult when survey data is limited. Several algorithms were used to predict the I. holocyclus distribution and to construct an ensemble model using the Biomod2 package at two spatial scales. This study demonstrated the potential for developing models of paralysis tick distribution at both state and local scales that have strong predictive power, as assessed through cross-validation (AUC =0.937 and AUC =0.981 respectively). Within Queensland, 11 local government areas consist of at least 80% potential paralysis tick habitat. The local-scale model indicated a higher probability of tick occurrence concentrated around Redland City and North West Brisbane.This research has identified both the potential and limitations of applying novel genetics methods and species distribution models to disease ecology research. It identified the importance of parameter thresholds when genetic markers are used as an indirect estimator for contact networks. It used two different methods for blood meal analysis to show the diversity of hosts for the paralysis tick, identified a potential genetic break in the population structure of ticks using newly discovered SNP markers, and provided two species distribution models that have the potential to inform management activities. Development in genetic and genomic tools is revolutionising disease ecology research, though ongoing research is required to evaluate the efficacy of these developments and determine best practice for their application."
Three-Dimensional Urban Land Cover Classification by Prior-Level Fusion of LiDAR Point Cloud and Optical Imagery,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d8d9a8b6b71d26de28631045b3c18f8049d60c9,Yanming Chen; Xiaoqiang Liu; Yijia Xiao; Qiqi Zhao; Sida Wan,"The heterogeneity of urban landscape in the vertical direction should not be neglected in urban ecology research, which requires urban land cover product transformation from two-dimensions to three-dimensions using light detection and ranging system (LiDAR) point clouds. Previous studies have demonstrated that the performance of two-dimensional land cover classification can be improved by fusing optical imagery and LiDAR data using several strategies. However, few studies have focused on the fusion of LiDAR point clouds and optical imagery for three-dimensional land cover classification, especially using a deep learning framework. In this study, we proposed a novel prior-level fusion strategy and compared it with the no-fusion strategy (baseline) and three other commonly used fusion strategies (point-level, feature-level, and decision-level). The proposed prior-level fusion strategy uses two-dimensional land cover derived from optical imagery as the prior knowledge for three-dimensional classification. Then, a LiDAR point cloud is linked to the prior information using the nearest neighbor method and classified by a deep neural network. Our proposed prior-fusion strategy has higher overall accuracy (82.47%) on data from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, compared with the baseline (74.62%), point-level (79.86%), feature-level (76.22%), and decision-level (81.12%). The improved accuracy reflects two features: (1) fusing optical imagery to LiDAR point clouds improves the performance of three-dimensional urban land cover classification, and (2) the proposed prior-level strategy directly uses semantic information provided by the two-dimensional land cover classification rather than the original spectral information of optical imagery. Furthermore, the proposed prior-level fusion strategy provides a series that fills the gap between two- and three-dimensional land cover classification."
Potential Differences and Methods of Determining Gypsy Moth Female Flight Capabilities: Implications for the Establishment and Spread in Novel Habitats,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1da02149d4478984a91064373727a4cb97effefa,V. Srivastava; M. Keena; G. Maennicke; R. Hamelin; V. Griess,"The introduction of the Asian gypsy moth into novel environments continues with frequent interceptions in North America. There is a concern that these subspecies will pose a greater threat to the forests and urban environments of North America than the established gypsy moths (Lymantria dispardispar L.), due to their greater capacity for female flight. Asian gypsy moth populations vary in many key traits, including female flight capabilities. The potential impacts of female flight, in combination with the other key traits, on the ecology and spread of this insect are first discussed in this communication. This also provides the first review of most of the current literature on the variations in flight capability and flight distance of gypsy moth populations, as well as variation in other traits of concern and the potential methods of identification, with special attention paid to the Asian subspecies Lymantria dispar japonica Motschulsky and Lymantria dispar asiatica Vinkovskij. There are currently good tools for identifying the general origin of introduced gypsy moth populations, but these do not provide enough information to effectively manage introductions. Gypsy moth key traits differ among populations, even within each subspecies of the gypsy moth, so introduction of gypsy moths from other world areas into locations where the gypsy moth is already present could result in unwanted changes in gypsy moth biology. It also appears that the introduction of flight-capable females could enhance a population’s dispersal capability and require modifications to management protocols used for flightless females. Therefore, rapid tools to assess key traits in introduced populations are needed to adequately plan for, or deal with, new introductions into novel habitats."

Tzaninis; Tait Mandler; Maria Kaika; Roger Keil,"Urban political ecology (UPE) focuses on unsettling traditional understandings of ‘cities’ as ontological entities separate from ‘nature’ and on how the production of settlements is metabolically linked with flows of capital and more-than-human ecological processes. The contribution of this paper is to recalibrate UPE to new urban forms and processes of extended urbanization. This exploration goes against the reduction of what goes on outside of cities to processes that emanate unidirectionally from cities. Acknowledging UPE’s rich intellectual history and aiming to enrich rather than split the field, this paper identifies four emerging discourses that go beyond UPE’s original formulation."

The research results show that Kosambi Green Route Park offers a variety of facilities, such as a jogging track, huts, and children's play areas, which are visitors' favorites. This park's access is good via private vehicles and public transportation, with supporting infrastructure that supports visitor comfort. Visitor preferences highlight the need for better care and maintenance of existing facilities and requests for further development, such as the addition of sports facilities and further green areas for picnics. The positive impacts felt by local communities include improved physical and social well-being and contributions to the surrounding environment through improved air quality and environmental awareness. Kosambi Green Lane Park is a successful example of the green lane concept in sustainable urban development. Still, there needs to be continuous attention to maintenance and development so that the benefits can continue to be felt in the long term."

Backenson,"Abstract Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) and human babesiosis are tick-borne diseases spread by the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis Say, Acari: Ixodidae) and are the result of infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti, respectively. In NewYork State (NYS), incidence rates of these diseases increased concordantly until around 2013, when rates of HGA began to increase more rapidly than human babesiosis, and the spatial extent of the diseases diverged. Surveillance data of tick-borne pathogens (2007 to 2018) and reported human cases of HGA (n = 4,297) and human babesiosis (n = 2,986) (2013–2018) from the NewYork State Department of Health (NYSDOH) showed a positive association between the presence/temporal emergence of each pathogen and rates of disease in surrounding areas. Incidence rates of HGA were higher than human babesiosis among White and non-Hispanic/non-Latino individuals, as well as all age and sex groups. Human babesiosis exhibited higher rates among non-White individuals. Climate, weather, and landscape data were used to build a spatially weighted zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model to examine and compare associations between the environment and rates of HGA and human babesiosis. HGA and human babesiosis ZINB models indicated similar associations with forest cover, forest land cover change, and winter minimum temperature; and differing associations with elevation, urban land cover change, and winter precipitation. These results indicate that tick-borne disease ecology varies between pathogens spread by I. scapularis."

Drawing upon land use data from 2000 to 2020 in Lintao County, Gansu Province, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the dynamics governing land use transformation. Subsequently, employing the FLUS (Future Land Use Simulation) model, we simulated the projected land use for Lintao County in 2035 under various scenarios. Furthermore, we utilized the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs) model to assess the change in carbon stock within the study area under each scenario. These analyses aim to furnish a robust scientific foundation for future land use planning endeavors in Lintao County. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The land use transition in Lintao County from 2000 to 2020 showed the strongest motivation for construction land growth, with continued rapid growth in the scale of urban land and other construction land and relatively slow growth in the land for rural settlement areas, while cropland and water areas continued to decrease, forest land grew slowly, the magnitude of land use change exhibited a higher intensity in river townships compared with mountainous townships. (2) The simulation results of cropland protection scenario (CPS), ecological protection scenario (EPS), economic development scenario (EDS), and comprehensive development scenario (CDS) in 2035 are better. Among them, the CDS, which considers various types of higher-level strategic requirements and can compensate for the single-goal nature of the single-demand scenario, demonstrates a higher level of rationality in the land use pattern. (3) The total carbon stock in descending order is the EPS, CDS, EDS, and CPS. Among these, the CDS is at a higher level of total carbon stock, and the changes in carbon stock in each land use site are more balanced, which is an ideal carbon stock state and a scenario more in line with multi-objective coordination."
Editorial,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1e3af6c31f9330e58ddd80cfef469bce9102de51,Editorial team of Babylonia,"As spring 2024 gets underway in many Swiss cities, urban and Sunday dilly-dalliers may well have been taken by surprise by the sight of wild plants and multicolored flowers in once neatly manicured green areas. 
For some years now, close-cropped lawns and carefully thought-out flower beds have been giving way to wilder, more natural spaces: flower patches in the city. These colorful expanses of meadow flowers are gaining ground in our urban environments, and with them many benefits for biodiversity. 
This issue of Babylonia is not, of course, about biodiversity as such (nor does it deal with the subject of linguistic ecology), but the parallels with efforts to take variety and variation into account in the language classroom are obvious. We show a less monogamous, more natural perspective on the languages and dialects present in the language classroom, one in which rigid norms and uniform approaches give way to a growing recognition of linguistic diversity. On the contrary, as several contributions in this issue show, rigorous pedagogical management of linguistic diversity (in repertoires, skills, registers, etc.) is fundamental. 
At a time when Switzerland has been sanctioned by the European Court of Human Rights for its climate policy, we leave you to judge the initiatives taken in Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain and China to promote linguistic diversity in the language classroom for yourselves.

Ecosystems across the United States are changing in complex and surprising ways. Ongoing demand for critical ecosystem services requires an understanding of the populations and communities in these ecosystems in the future. This paper represents a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Founda-tion-funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the core research area of “ populations and communities. ” The objective of this effort was to show the importance of long-term data collection and experiments for addressing the hardest questions in scienti ﬁ c ecology that have signi ﬁ cant implications for environmental policy and management. Each LTER site developed at least one compelling case study about what their site could look like in 50 – 100 yr as human and environmental drivers in ﬂ uencing speci ﬁ c ecosystems change. As the case studies were prepared, ﬁ ve themes emerged, and the studies were grouped into papers in this LTER Futures Special Feature addressing state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the “ connectivity ” theme and has examples from the Phoenix (urban), Niwot Ridge (alpine tundra), McMurdo Dry Valleys (polar desert), Plum Island (coastal), Santa Barbara Coastal (coastal), and Jornada (arid grassland and shrubland) sites. Connectivity has multiple dimensions, ranging from multi-scalar interactions in space to complex interactions over time that govern the transport of materials and the distribution and movement of organisms. The case studies presented here range widely, showing how land-use legacies interact with climate to alter the structure and function of arid ecosystems and ﬂ ows of resources and organisms in Antarctic polar desert, alpine, urban, and coastal marine ecosystems. Long-term ecological research demonstrates that connectivity can, in some circumstances, sustain valuable ecosystem functions, such as the persistence of foundation species and their associated biodiversity or, it can be an agent of state change, as when it increases wind and water erosion. Increased connectivity due to warming can also lead to species range expansions or contractions and the introduction of undesirable species. Continued long-term studies are essential for addressing the complexities of connectivity. The diversity of ecosystems within the LTER network is a strong platform for these studies."

Study on Spatial Optimization of Urban Waterfront from the Perspective of Urban Renewal -- A Case Study of Dongguan Watertown Functional Area,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1e5cddc9423d2f2d548fe45b7cabd0da920153dc,Mingli Li,"As an important public open space in the city, the spatial optimization of the waterfront is related to the overall style of the key urban areas and the quality of life of residents. Urban renewal combined with the waterfront space can effectively improve the vitality of the city and promote the development of the city. Due to the existing urban design itself for the material form of the emphasis and the lack of legal effect, the reality of waterfront space is still facing many problems, urgently need to be optimized. Urban renewal combined with waterfront space is a practical and efficient development path. Dongguan water function areas, for example, analyzing large river flood in the city plays an important role, based on space situation, under the background of urban renewal, from water body restoration, bank and revetment, roads and Bridges, the skyline and such, around the architecture and functions of five levels, to explore how the dongguan water function areas have local characteristics of waterfront space design, And put forward the optimization strategy. Centering on the aspects of ecology, culture and function, the overall planning strategy is put forward: combining ecology to create green waterfront space, combining culture to create characteristic waterfront space, combining function to create poetic waterfront space."

Studies on bird diversity in the cities are important to better understanding to the ecology of urban and sub-urban landscapes. The aim of this study was research on bird diversity in urban parks in Olomouc city in order to brief comparison with bird diversity in hardwood floodplain forest habitats based on our older above-mentioned study. Bird diversity in urban parks was very similar to the bird diversity in some localities of floodplain forests from the Czech Republic. Comparison between urban parks and hardwood floodplain forests in the vicinity of the city revealed a high similarity of alpha-diversity and diversity indexes. These results indicated that large urban parks have nearly the same importance for bird diversity such as managed hardwood floodplain forests. Results highlighted an importance of urban green areas for biodiversity maintaining in European cultural landscapes."

Citizen-science data identifies the daily movement patterns and habitat associations of a nocturnal urban-invading bird species (Corvus frugilegus),2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ecf073780fb5c4f94bbae8f27db901c80659cec,Jiweon Yun; Wonhyeop Shin; Jihwan Kim; James H. Thorne; Youngkeun Song,"Rooks (Corvus frugilegus) are an invasive bird species in South Korea that are deemed harmful due to nocturnal urban invasions and agricultural damage. Employing citizen science data, we document the daily movement patterns and habitat associations of nocturnal urban-invading rooks in Suwon, South Korea. We collected 4,522 geolocated observations from December 2021 to March 2022, categorized by the timings of sunrise and sunset and segmented into 3-h intervals. Using the MaxENT (Maximum Entropy Model) and k-fold cross-validation (k = 10) with a 25% random test sample, we analyzed daily movement patterns and habitat preferences. Our results show that rooks forage in agricultural areas shortly after sunrise and roost in urban environments after sunset. Urban roosts tend to occur in areas near buildings of medium height (6–20 stories) that are illuminated by artificial light and contain utility poles. The variables with the highest percent contribution to rooks’ presence after sunset were buildings of medium height (20.7%), land use type (19.4%), elevation (29%), and utility pole (14.5%). Our findings emphasize the potential of citizen science initiatives to generate insights into the ecology of invasive bird species within large urban environments."

Johnson,"ABSTRACT In this essay, we describe how rhetoric’s theories of temporality can inform ongoing urban development. We examine a transportation planning case to suggest that urban development must value contributions from people, places, and ecologies with their own unique rhythms. We coin the term coeval rhetorical temporalities to describe the multiple and sometimes conflicting scales of time that nonhuman and human participants bring to transportation planning. To demonstrate our notion of coeval rhetorical temporalities and the consequences of disregarding them, we highlight how human notions of progress are being used to legitimize road development that is neither efficient, ethical, nor resilient."
The kind of problem a smart city is,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1edf9675f1305264ef5d8599b295ebe3a55c4a0f,Austin Hestdalen,"Digital technologies not only alter the material fabric of cities, but condition and constrain the complex networks of trust that emerge among neighbours and strangers as they engage one another in shared civic spaces. In this sense, a media ecology of the city would borrow from studies of urban sociology, political economy and cybernetics to reconsider what ethical implications smart technologies would have when sown into the fabric of an urban environment. This article introduces Jane Jacobs’s urban theory as a complexity approach to media ecology that provides insight into how urban environments, as media of communication and commerce, cultivate the ethical character of social relations among neighbours and strangers. It is argued that Jacobs’s urban theory provides sufficient ground for figuring the ethical implications of highly integrated and ubiquitous digital technologies within the organized complexity of urban environments and offers an alternative way of cultivating urban ecologies of communication."

Soil as a transdisciplinary research catalyst: from bioprospecting to biorespecting,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1eeff35aa0d04508d05fab2180b94772e630fba6,Matthew J. Tarnowski; G. Varliero; Jim Scown; Emily Phelps; T. Gorochowski,"The vast microbial biodiversity of soils is beginning to be observed and understood by applying modern DNA sequencing techniques. However, ensuring this potentially valuable information is used in a fair and equitable way remains a challenge. Here, we present a public engagement project that explores this topic through collaborative research of soil microbiomes at six urban locations using nanopore-based DNA sequencing. The project brought together researchers from the disciplines of synthetic biology, environmental humanities and microbial ecology, as well as school students aged 14–16 years old, to gain a broader understanding of views on the use of data from the environment. Discussions led to the transformation of ‘bioprospecting’, a metaphor with extractive connotations which is often used to frame environmental DNA sequencing studies, towards a more collaborative approach—‘biorespecting’. This shift in terminology acknowledges that genetic information contained in soil arises as a result of entire ecosystems, including the people involved in its creation. Therefore, any use of sequence information should be accountable to the ecosystems from which it arose. As knowledge can arise from ecosystems and communities, science and technology should acknowledge this link and reciprocate with care and benefit-sharing to help improve the wellbeing of future generations."
Social-Environmental Analysis for the Management of Coastal Lagoons in North Africa,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f0163247cca12c53ffcbaf09482ad371f26c7b0,Badr El Mahrad; Samuel Abalansa; A. Newton; J. Icely; M. Snoussi; I. Kacimi,"This study provides an overview of 11 lagoons in North Africa, from the Atlantic to the Eastern Mediterranean. Lagoons are complex, transitional, coastal zones providing valuable ecosystem services that contribute to the welfare of the human population. The main economic sectors in the lagoons included fishing, shellfish harvesting, and salt and sand extraction, as well as maritime transport. Economic sectors in the areas around the lagoons and in the watershed included agriculture, tourism, recreation, industrial, and urban development. Changes were also identified in land use from reclamation, changes in hydrology, changes in sedimentology from damming, inlet modifications, and coastal engineering. The human activities in and around the lagoons exert multiple pressures on these ecosystems and result in changes in the environment, affecting salinity, dissolved oxygen, and erosion; changes in the ecology, such as loss of biodiversity; and changes in the delivery of valuable ecosystem services. Loss of ecosystem services such as coastal protection and seafood affect human populations that live around the lagoons and depend on them for their livelihood. Adaptive management frameworks for social–ecological systems provide options that support decision makers with science-based knowledge to deliver sustainable development for ecosystems. The framework used to support the decision makers for environmental management of these 11 lagoons is Drivers–Activities–Pressures–State Change–Impact (on Welfare)–Responses (as Measures)."
The Impact of Excessive Species Density in An Area on The Local Ecology,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f074b9122291588434af953b8ea6aeb3dd3954e,Zhuoran Xiang,"“Biodiversity overabundance” is a term used to describe a situation where species densities (the number of species in a given area) have become unsustainable and localized species densities have exceeded the carrying capacity of the ecosystem as a whole. As urbanization compresses wildlife habitats, excessive species density can lead to ecological imbalances, including competitive exclusion and declines in less competitive species. This study explores the impacts of high species density on biodiversity, resource competition, and human-wildlife interactions in Malaysia. The findings highlight intensified resource competition, increased disease transmission, and heightened human-wildlife conflicts, particularly in urban areas. Notable examples include the rise of zoonotic diseases linked to dense wildlife populations. To address these challenges, effective management strategies are proposed, including restoring predator-prey dynamics, implementing population control measures, and integrating urban planning with environmental protection. By balancing species density and fostering coexistence between humans and wildlife, Malaysia can promote sustainable biodiversity management and enhance ecosystem health. The study emphasizes the need for ongoing research and collaboration among stakeholders to mitigate the adverse effects of excessive species density and ensure long-term ecological stability."

Rotten capital: Rethinking urban metabolism with mold,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f157452c4203f363fc2e629d5fae7f6d96f6a66,Christoph Schemann,"This article brings mold metabolisms into dialogue with urban metabolism in urban political ecology (UPE) and animal geographies by conceiving mold and its spores as vital objects to think with for an enriched understanding of a more-than-human urban metabolism. Both research strands, UPE and animal geographies, offer several conjunctions: the city as a common contact zone, lively commodities, and animate capital. Mold fungi understood in terms of their most vital metabolistic function (growth and reproduction) in regard to rot, decomposition, and their transformative capacity of changing states between airborne spores and spatialized colonies will be related to some of the most significant objects of research in urban metabolism like water, built structures, commodities, waste, and capital. This, then, helps to flesh out the concept of Rotten Capital that is organized around two key categories of critical engagement: first, Rotten Capital as a form of urban metabolism that (de-)territorializes microbial mobilities, effecting the (de-)valuation of labor, commodities and capital (dis)investments; secondly, Rotten Capital as a form of (un)intended obsolescence and creative destruction in the wider logic of capital circulation and accumulation, in which mold is functionally similar to but accelerates “time” in the decay of value. Thus, three different moldy trajectories (mold as hydrological cyborg fungus, mold's spatial fix, and mold's biosemiotic switch) will be explained in discussing mold as a potent driver entangled in more-than-human urban metabolisms that can become profitably utilized in different directions in the form of Rotten Capital."

Home range and habitat usage are part of the ecological study, which was less explored in disease ecology. In this study, Rattus norvegicus (RN), Rattus rattus complex (RR), and Sundamys muelleri (SM) were chosen due to their high prevalence with pathogenic Leptospira. Three pairs of each species were tracked from urban, semi-urban, and forested areas. The rats were fitted with a transmitter radio-collar and tracked with a portable telemetry receiver consisting of a 3-element Yagi antenna and located using standard methods of ground-based triangulation. Home range and core area were higher in the forest species (SM) than urban species (RN and RR). RN roaming and nesting areas were restricted inside houses and sewers, which is similar to RR roaming outside houses but nesting in houses. SM shows more expansive roaming areas in the forest but occasionally visits dump sites. Food resources, primarily from leftovers and dumping sites, were found to be the main factor in the viability of these species. The information on the movement ecology of rats could give accurate and valuable data on the population control, by targeting the specific areas occupied by the rats.

Penggunaan kawasan keliaran dan makrohabitat oleh tikus perumah takungan utama Leptospira di Selangor, Malaysia. Tikus adalah pembawa utama penyakit leptospirosis. Kawasan keliaran dan penggunaan habitat adalah sebahagian daripada kajian ekologi yang kurang dieksplorasi dalam ekologi penyakit. Dalam kajian ini, Rattus norvegicus (RN), Rattus rattus complex (RR), dan Sundamys muelleri (SM) dipilih disebabkan prevalen tinggi mereka dengan Leptospira patogenik. Tiga pasang dari setiap spesies dijejaki dari kawasan bandar, pinggiran bandar, dan hutan. Tikus-tikus ini dipasangkan dengan kolar-radio pemancar dan dijejaki dengan penerima telemetri mudah alih yang terdiri daripada antena Yagi 3-elemen dan dikesan menggunakan kaedah triangulasi atas tanah yang standard. Kawasan keliaran dan kawasan teras adalah lebih besar untuk spesies hutan (SM) berbanding dengan spesies bandar (RN dan RR). Kawasan merayau dan bersarang RN adalah terhad di dalam rumah dan sistem pembentungan, hampir sama dengan RR yang merayau di luar rumah tetapi bersarang di dalam rumah. SM menunjukkan kawasan merayau yang lebih luas di hutan, tetapi kadang-kadang melawat tapak pelupusan sampah. Sumber makanan, terutamanya dari sisa-sisa makanan dan tapak pelupusan sampah, didapati menjadi faktor utama dalam keupayaan spesies ini untuk terus hidup. Maklumat mengenai ekologi pergerakan tikus boleh memberikan data yang tepat dan bernilai mengenai kawalan populasi, iaitu dengan menumpukan kepada kawasan-kawasan tertentu yang didiami oleh tikus."
Planning of Fast-charging Stations Considering Heterogeneous Charging Patterns in Electrified Transportation Networks,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f260c4fb84cff3d1404031f574dbc1d892d101c,Huaidong Yang; Xun Li; Jing Ge; Peng Huang; Guanyu Zhou,"The coexistence of heterogeneous charging patterns complicates the location of fast-charging stations for electric vehicles in an urban city area. Existing planning models will produce less-effective siting and sizing decisions, which are expected to inevitably block the further development of electric vehicle ecology. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates the location and sizing of FCSs on electrified transportation networks and proposes a mixed integer second order cone program (MISOCP), which considers both en route and destination charging demands. The AC power flow conditions of power distribution systems are also incorporated. The model's effectiveness is validated using benchmark systems, and the tradeoffs between heterogeneous types of demands are revealed."

This paper explores the concept of Ecological Urbanism as a framework to convert cities from being waste generators to resource producers. The example of the wastewater from Bengaluru going into the lakes of Kolar is studied. The treated wastewater of the city reaches Kolar to fill its lakes, which subsequently recharges the groundwater . One city’s waste becomes another’s resource in this process. The case of Kolar-Bengaluru is studied while asking critical questions of urban-rural planning with ecology as a main premise."

Costa,"Background The presence of synanthropic rodents, such as Rattus norvegicus, in urban environments generates high costs of prophylaxis and control, in large part due to the environmental transmission of the pathogenic spirochete Leptospira interrogans, which causes leptospirosis. In Salvador, Brazil, The Center for Control of Zoonosis (CCZ) is responsible for planning and implementing Rodent Control Programs (RCP) which are based on chemical rodenticide. However, these strategies have not been standardized for use in developing countries. Aim This study aimed to identify the effect of a chemical control campaign on the demographic variables of urban R. norvegicus, analyzing relative abundance, sex structure, body mass, and age of the population, as well as the characterization of spatial distribution among households, rodent capture campaigns and interventions. Methods This study was carried out during 2015 in three valleys of an urban poor community in Salvador. Individuals of R. norvegicus were systematically captured before (Pre-intervention) and three months (1st post-intervention) and six months (2nd post-intervention) after a chemical control intervention conducted by the CCZ in two valleys of the study area while the third valley was not included in the intervention campaign and was used as a non-intervention reference. We used analysis of variance to determine if intervention affected demographic variables and chi-square to compare proportions of infested households (Rodent infestation index–PII). Results During the chemical intervention, 939 households were visited. In the pre-intervention campaign, an effort of 310 trap nights resulted in 43 rodents captured, and in the 1st and 2nd, post-intervention campaigns resulted in 47 rodents captured over 312 trap nights and 36 rodents captured over 324 traps-nights, respectively. The rodent infestation index (PII) points did not show a reduction between the period before the intervention and the two periods after the chemical intervention (70%, 72%, and 65%, respectively). Regarding relative abundances, there was no difference between valleys and period before and two periods after chemical intervention (trap success valley 1: 0,18; 0,19; 0,18 / Valley 3 0,15; 0,17; 0,13/ P>0,05). Other demographic results showed that there was no difference in demographic characteristics of the rodent population before and after the intervention, as well as there being no influence of the application of rodenticide on the areas of concentration of capture of rodents between the campaigns. Conclusion Our study indicates that the chemical control was not effective in controlling the population of R. norvegicus and provides evidence of the need for re-evaluation of rodent control practices in urban poor community settings."

Panjang Island, which is at the mouth of the Kapuas River, is an island that divides the Kapuas River into the Big Kapuas River and the Small Kapuas River. This island has varieties of vegetation in riparian areas that have different and varied characters. So, the varied vegetation patterns in the riparian areas make the water quality different in each zone (Ratih, 2022). The Panjang Island riparian area is an area that is threatened by human activities around it, and with the plan to build the Kapuas III Toll Bridge which will pass through this island, of course there will be a shift in land use functions around the Panjang Island riparian area and also the Kapuas River. This research is a continuation of previous research, where digital identification and mapping was carried out on Panjang Island, namely by developing a concept and making a design model for the Panjang Island riparian area, which still maintains the conservation of the riparian area."

I begin by exploring insect hotels’ phenomenon, history, and aims. I then take a closer look at DIY guides and instructions on how to build an insect hotel. According to studies in urban ecology, the original goals of supporting biodiversity are poorly realized. Instead, I state that insect hotels can be seen as a practice of staying with the trouble. With this focus and with some works of art, complex questions of agency, representation, knowledge, power, government, and control can be examined.   "
More Than Open Space! The Case for Green Infrastructure Teaching in Planning Curricula,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f4bc4a0b347821b8c2ba4a82de730b4b1487536,A. Frank; A. Flynn; Nicholas Hacking; Christopher Silver,"Since the mid-1990s, the concept of Green Infrastructure (GI) has been gaining traction in fields such as ecology and forestry, (landscape) architecture, environmental and hydrological engineering, public health as well as urban and regional planning. Definitions and aims ascribed to GI vary. Yet, agreement broadly exists on GI’s ability to contribute to sustainability by means of supporting, for example, biodiversity, human and animal health, and storm water management as well as mitigating urban heat island effects. Given an acknowledged role of planners in delivering sustainable cities and towns, professional bodies have highlighted the need for spatial planners to understand and implement GI. This raises questions of what sort of GI knowledge planners may require and moreover by whom and how GI knowledge and competencies may be conveyed? Examining knowledge and skills needs vis-à-vis GI education opportunities indicates a provision reliant primarily on continued professional education and limited ad hoc opportunities in Higher Education. The resulting knowledge base appears fragmented with limited theoretical foundations leading the authors to argue that a systematic inclusion of green infrastructure knowledges in initial planning education is needed to promote and aid effective GI implementation."
Human mobility and malaria risk in peri-urban and rural communities in the Peruvian Amazon,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f568b1b3bdc254f27e4353ad8ff5742ed925dc0,Joaquín Gómez; Alessandro Grosso; Mitchel Guzman-Guzman; Stefano Garcia Castillo; Marcia C. Castro; Katherine J Torres; Joseph M. Vinetz; D. Gamboa,"Background While the global burden of malaria cases has decreased over the last two decades, the disease remains a major international threat, even on the rise in many regions. More than 85% of Peruvian malaria cases are in the Amazonian region of Loreto. Internal mobility primarily related to occupation is thought to be primarily responsible for maintaining endemicity and introducing and reintroducing malaria parasites into areas of anophelism, a challenge for malaria eradication. Methods The assessment of connectivity produced by human mobility was evaluated in three districts of Loreto, through 10 cross-sectional population screening from 2018 to 2020. We use social network analysis (SNA) to obtain weighted and unweighted degrees of connectivity and explore its variability by socio-demographic characteristics. In addition, we integrated travel history and malaria incidence data to estimate parasite connectivity due to internal human mobility between locations. Finally, we used logistic multivariate regressions to explore the factors associated with Plasmodium spp. infection in mobile individuals. Results We found that internal human mobility results in high connectivity between communities from the Mazan, Iquitos, and San Juan Bautista districts. We identified nearby destinations that may act as sinks or sources for malaria transmission, including densely populated towns and rural campsites. In addition, we found that being a male, traveling to rural campsites, and working outdoors are associated with Plasmodium spp. infection in travelers from the Mazan district. Conclusions We provide compelling evidence about how human mobility connects rural communities in the Peruvian Amazon. Using SNA, we uncovered district-specific patterns and destinations, providing further evidence of human mobility heterogeneity in the region. To address the challenge of human mobility and malaria in this setting, geographic heterogeneity of malaria transmission must be considered. Author summary Malaria transmission is complex, involving interactions of parasite, vector biology and ecology, human immune response, and human host behavior. We used social network analysis to understand how the daily lives including occupation-related mobility leads to the maintenance of malaria endemicity and transmission. Rural communities (within the districts of Mazan) and peri-urban communities around the city of Iquitos have different socio-demographic characteristics that determine malaria transmission rates. Networks of fixed rural communities and occupation-related distant camp sites play a key role as reservoirs and sources of parasite movement. Factors including male sex, outdoor occupational activity outdoors, and having rural camp sites as travel destination increase the risk of Plasmodium infection. Factors associated with occupation-related mobility are correlated with incidence and prevalence of malarial disease and parasite infection rates, respectively. This work provides a detailed understanding of the importance of work-related travel to target in malaria elimination programs, key to maintaining malaria transmission both in the Amazon region and more generally."
A Quantified Methodology for Evaluating Engineering Sustainability: Ecological Footprint Measurement Modeling,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f56932c12c2d4848ff5858a299f1e81cfd16512,Jinli Jiang; Xiaojuan Li; Liyan Yu; Jianqiang Jin; Xian Liang,"With the gradual increase in public awareness of ecological environmental protection, how to manage the increasingly tight supply of natural ecological energy and resources and the more evident greenhouse effect, how to properly treat and deal with the relationship between people, engineering and the ecological environment during the construction phase of engineering projects as well as how to evaluate the degree of environmental friendliness and sustainable development ability of engineering projects will become an urgent issue. Stakeholders in engineering projects must seriously consider these vital issues. Existing studies on the evaluation of engineering–ecology sustainable development capacity mainly focus on the regional and industry levels, with less research focusing on the sustainability of individual engineering projects; furthermore, they are primarily concentrated on the qualitative evaluation perspective. In order to refine these shortcomings, based on the viewpoint of the ecosystem of construction projects, this paper integrates the concept of whole life cycle with the ecological footprint measurement model and defines the notion of the ecological footprint of the whole life cycle of construction projects. Subsequently taking the above concept as the foundation and making the ecological footprint of various activities throughout the life cycle of a construction project a specific study object, the research establishes the ecological footprint measurement model of the whole life cycle of the project, and comprehensively evaluates the impacts on the surrounding environment, which include the consumption of energy resources, CO2 and the absorption of solid wastes across the whole life cycle of the project. We then measure the sustainable development ability of engineering projects by comparing the ecological footprint with the ecological carrying capacity of a certain surrounding region. Finally, the practicability and reliability of the model is verified through the example’s application. Thus, the results of the study have significant theoretical and practical implications: (1) the introduction of the ecological footprint addresses the gap about the quantitative evaluation of the sustainability of individual engineering projects from a micro perspective; (2) it compensates for the shortcomings of other evaluation methods that only evaluate a single element, such as only CO2, resources, energy or solid waste and so on; and (3) stakeholders can use the measured model to quantitatively assess the sustainability of new projects or urban renewal projects, providing strong support for project feasibility studies and project-establishment."
Spectral-Cascaded Diffusion Model for Remote Sensing Image Spectral Super-Resolution,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f6187006d4727fa7275ca846d428916d62dedfc,Bo Chen; Liqin Liu; Chenyang Liu; Zhengxia Zou; Z. Shi,"Hyperspectral remote sensing images (HSIs) have unique advantages in urban planning, precision agriculture, and ecology monitoring since they provide rich spectral information. However, hyperspectral imaging usually suffers from low spatial resolution and high cost, which limits the wide application of hyperspectral data. Spectral super-resolution provides a promising solution to acquire hyperspectral images with high spatial resolution and low cost, taking RGB images as input. Existing spectral super-resolution methods utilize neural networks following a single-shot framework, i.e., final results are obtained by one-stage spectral super-resolution, which struggles to capture and model the complex relationships between spectral bands. In this article, we propose a spectral-cascaded diffusion model (SCDM), a coarse-to-fine spectral super-resolution method based on the diffusion model. The diffusion model fits the real data distribution through stepwise denoising, which is naturally suitable for modeling rich spectral information. We cascade the diffusion model in the spectral dimension to gradually refine the spectral trends and enrich spectral information of the pixels. The cascade solves the highly ill-posed problem of spectral super-resolution step-by-step, mitigating the inaccuracies of previous single-shot approaches. To better utilize the potential of the diffusion model for spectral super-resolution, we design image condition mixture guidance (ICMG) to enhance the guidance of image conditions and progressive dynamic truncation (PDT) to limit cumulative errors in the sampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in spectral super-resolution. Codes can be found at https://github.com/Mr-Bamboo/SCDM."

In order to accurately evaluate the health status of urban water cycles, the evaluation system covers four standard layers of water ecology, water abundance, water quality and water use, including 19 basic indicators such as water storage change and annual average precipitation. Three-scale AHP and EFAST algorithms are adopted to set the criterion and index layer weights. Water-cycle health assessment models are based on the improved TOPSIS model. The model evaluated Zhengzhou’s water cycle health from 2011 to 2021. We compared the TOPSIS model and FCE method to ensure the scientific objectivity of the evaluation results. The evaluation results indicated that the water cycle in Zhengzhou City improved annually, and the relative progress in 2020 was 0.567 in a sub-health state. The eco-environmental water demand, green coverage rate of the built district, water resources amount, and industry’s water consumption per unit of value added (CNY 10,000) were the major obstacles. These four factors have preponderantly influenced Zhengzhou City’s water cycle health. Our research results provide scientific reference for Zhengzhou to achieve a healthy urban water cycle and regional sustainable development."

Comprehensive evaluation of urban river ecological bank protection based on AHP-TOPSIS method,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f89143b06654e946028ab7166f425a6a2d9fe55,Shutian Li; Liu Yang; Jianyin Fang,"ABSTRACT An ecological revetment is a new type that combines natural vegetation with civil engineering technology to establish functions, such as flood control, drainage, ecology, and landscape. Various types of ecological and other bank protection lead to different bank protection effects. Urban river ecological bank protection can effectively prevent bank collapse and promote mutual infiltration between river water and soil and is important for maintaining the balance of the river ecosystem and enhancing the ecological service function of river bank protection. To scientifically and accurately evaluate the ecological protection of riverbanks, this study screened 16 evaluation indicators based on four aspects: structural stability, ecological functionality, landscape suitability, and socio-economic status. A comprehensive evaluation index system for urban river ecological protection was constructed and an urban river ecological protection evaluation model based on the AHP – TOPSIS method was established. The model was used to evaluate the ecological protection of the rivers in the study area. The results revealed that the evaluation value, 0.830, of the self-embedded retaining wall exhibited the best performance among the current slope protection types. In addition, structural stability is a crucial factor in river ecological revetments, and the evaluation results were consistent with the revetment type selected in actual engineering. Therefore, the evaluation system constructed in this study is reasonable and reliable and has strong generalizability. This study provides theoretical guidance for selecting ecological protection banks for future river management projects and has specific references important for academic research and the development of environmental protection banks.

The Author's View on the Use of Denim in a Suit,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f9a92af25b902ce24a66e323676d577140c254f,Yu. Zelenova; Yu. Pridannikova; A. Rogova,"The presented article reflects the views and suggestions of the authors on the development of denim clothing. The rationale for the relevance of using denim in a suit, its history, production stages and features of its influence on the state of the ecology of our planet is given. Denim is a universal material for tailoring, both in terms of its utilitarian qualities and from the point of view of its integration into various fashion styles, and therefore, denim products are in demand every fashion season, regardless of the time of year. The purpose of the study is to develop an original collection of women's denim dresses based on an analysis of consumer preferences in accordance with modern trends. Methods used in the study: 1) system analysis method; 2) method of comparative analysis; 3) historical and cultural method; 4) sociological survey method; 5) synthesis method; 6) method of analogy; 7) associative method; 8) design method; 9) combinatorial method. A study of the target audience (girls and women aged 18 to 35 years) using a sociological survey method demonstrated that the majority of respondents wear denim products, and 70% of respondents prefer current denim dresses to classic jeans. Such high popularity dictates new conditions for the development of methods for the production of denim fabric and its consumption in the process of sewing clothes. To achieve this, the authors reduced the percentage of inter-curves by reusing them as decoration for the collection. The result of the research was the development and implementation by the authors of a collection of women’s denim dresses under the motto “Urban Jungle”. It is based on silhouettes, colors, textures corresponding to the spring-summer 2025 fashion season, meeting the preferences of the selected target audience."
Sylvatic Mosquito Diversity in Kenya—Considering Enzootic Ecology of Arboviruses in an Era of Deforestation,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1fb22562d395f90e178ac7c9a637713c3fb028c2,Gillian Eastwood; R. Sang; J. Lutomiah; Philip Tunge; S. Weaver,"As new and re-emerging vector-borne diseases are occurring across the world, East Africa represents an interesting location, being the origin of several arboviruses with a history of urbanization and global spread. Rapid expansion of urban populations and alteration of natural habitats creates the opportunity for arboviruses to host-switch from wild, sylvatic hosts or vectors into urban transmission affecting human populations. Although mosquito surveillance regularly takes place in urban areas of Kenya, for example identifying vectors of dengue virus or malaria viruses, little work has been carried out to determine the distribution and abundance of sylvatic vectors. Here, we describe the mosquito vector species and diversity collected at twelve forest habitats of rural Kenya. We conducted arbovirus screening of over 14,082 mosquitoes (47 species, 11 genera) as 1520 pools, and detected seven viruses (six bunyaviruses, and one flavivirus-bunyavirus co-infection) isolated from pools of Aedes dentatus, Anopheles funestus, Culex annulioris, and Cx. vansomereni. Awareness of sylvatic vector species and their location is a critical part of understanding the ecological foci and enzootic cycling of pathogens that may be of concern to public, animal or wildlife health. As natural ecosystems come under anthropogenic pressures, such knowledge can inform us of the One Health potential for spillover or spillback leading to outbreaks, and assist in vector control strategies."

CSR is running business successfully while preserving ecology and morality. This study is an effort to realize intuitions of bankers about CSR through systematic support of its complex angles. Literature shows that CSR activities are beneficial for bank clients, employees, environment, society, economy and even banks. The population of the study comprised of bankers, from whom a sample of ten respondents was selected through purposive sampling. Scholars have utilized qualitative research methods to incite audio recorded open-ended interviews of bankers that were analyzed through constructivist version of grounded theory. Findings of the study show that CSR is a style where firms are run to earn profit and take care of all stakeholders. Resultantly, banks increased their spending on CSR that motivated their staff and raised their brand image. Furthermore, banks should increase their branches and public awareness about banks and provide free or discounted banking services to needy sections of the society and spend more on edification, health, hygiene, urban growth, women empowerment, games, art, culture and relief funds. Results of the study show that bankers perceive CSR as essential for banks success, impacting the industry through activities like community engagement, environmental preservation, and employee welfare, ultimately leading to positive brand reputation and societal benefits, with recommendations for banks to expand their CSR efforts for greater impact. Recommendations of the study on hand show that banks must balance environmental, ethical, and societal considerations for long-term success; CSR has transformed banking through initiatives in education, healthcare, business support, and disaster relief, benefiting all the stakeholders. The study concluded with future research directions for the scholars in the area.

This method is becoming increasingly important due to the fact that water, pesticides, fertilizers, labor, equipment, energy and transportation costs are low, efficiency and quality are high, livestock can be carried out simultaneously, it improves the architecture and air of the city, and it will increase the interest and contribution of the city people to agriculture. Since it is predicted that the world population will be 10 billion in 2050, the ecological balance will deteriorate further and fertile land areas will rapidly decrease due to global warming, many countries have started to actively apply this agricultural method. Although the initial investment costs are high, this agricultural practice, which has high sustainability in terms of its contribution to the economy, ecology and social integration in the long term, will be the most important agricultural industry of the future. For this method, which is important in terms of sustainable agriculture, arrangements should be made in state policies and legal issues, financial resources should be allocated in our country, and the participation of academics, private sector, municipalities, farmers and urban society in the process should be ensured."
"Development of a water-vegetable frame of an urban area (Isilkul city, Omsk region)",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1fd02d65c4b7ae6bc7bd20df00d9ace795d46ea0,P. Bolshanik; S. Kusnezova; Boris V. Usovich,"The formation of a comfortable urban environment is inextricably linked with the planning of an anthropogenic landscape that performs environmental, reclamation and recreational functions. 
""Ecological frame of the city"", ""landscape-ecological frame"", ""water-green city frame"", ""landscape-recreational frame of the city"" - these are essentially synonymous phrases that are used in scientific and special literature depending on the scale and detail of the study. and urban landscape planning [Targaeva, 2022]. The term ""ecological frame"" was introduced into the everyday life of researchers by V.V. Vladimirov (1980, 1986). Later, the terminology of urban landscape ecology was developed in [Runova, 1993; Kuleshova, 1999; Georgita, 2011; Tukmanov, 2012]. Among the scientific works of contemporaries devoted to the history and development of the theory of urban landscape planning, the works of E.Yu. Kolbovsky et al. [2008, 2018]. In foreign literature, the ecological structure of cities has been defined as ecological network (ecological network) or green infrastructure (green infrastructure) [Green infrastructure..., 2013; Podoinitsyna, 2016; Klimanov, 2018]. According to its functional purpose, green infrastructure corresponds to the domestic green frame of the city [Baro et all., 2014]. 
This paper discusses the issues of landscape planning of the city of Isilkul, the center of the district of the same name in the Omsk region. Given the size and specialization, the current geo-ecological problems of the settlement and the natural and climatic conditions of the forest-steppe, the term water-plant urban frame is used. The water-vegetation urban frame is a structured set of adjacent territories with vegetation cover and water bodies within the city limits and its immediate environs, which performs environment-forming, reclamation and recreational functions. 
Currently, the western regions of the Omsk region are characterized by the processes of rising groundwater levels, which caused flooding in 24 zones, with a total area of about 60 thousand hectares. Within one of these zones is the city of Isilkul. An unfavorable geo-ecological situation has developed in the city and in the adjacent territories, associated with swamping, and in some cases, salinization of soils. 
The purpose of this article is to substantiate measures for the creation of a water-vegetation frame of Isilkul, located on the southern outskirts of Western Siberia within the Ishim Plain. Among the objectives of the research: the study of the infrastructure of the city; reconstruction of natural landscapes; determining the causes of flooding of the territory, designing the water-vegetation frame of the urban area. 
 
Objects and methods of investigation 
The territory of the study object is located in the central part of the eastern half of the Ishim Plain and forms an ellipse in plan, elongated from north to south (Fig. 1). Within the boundaries of the object of study are located Isilkul with its suburbs, partly the land of rural settlements of the Isilkul administrative district - Solntsevo, Boevoye, Lesnoye. In the north, the study area includes a fragment of the territory of the Kamyshlov log tract, in the south - the basin of the lake. Settlement. 
The choice of research methods was determined by the specifics of the tasks being solved and the landscape features of the study area. First of all, this concerns a significant transformation of natural landscapes in the vicinity of the city and the need to reconstruct ecosystems in the built-up area. Another important methodological task was the development of recommendations for the localization of processes that cause flooding of the urban landscape. The use of traditional landscape methods and techniques for solving the set tasks turned out to be ineffective. This required a combination of field and office methods of landscape ecology and environmental protection, which included. 
In total, 30 observation points were described during the research. Two landscape profiles of 12 km (along the line Kamyshlov Log - Lake Gorodishche) and 2 km (from west to east through Isilkul) were broken up and examined. Natural, introduced and ruderal vegetation has been studied. Surveyed urban engineering networks, ways of surface water runoff. As part of office work, reports and cartographic materials of the State Historical Archive of the Omsk Region were analyzed; landscape map of the Omsk region. 
 
Results of research 
Prior to the start of construction, the territory of Isilkul was a flattened isometric upland typical of the Ishim steppe with a relative excess of height above the surrounding area of 1-5 m. The gentle slopes of the upland were occupied by grass-forb steppe meadows on carbonate chernozems and solods. Locally, in the hollows of the flat top and in moist relief depressions along its periphery, spiked aspen-birch forests grew in a mosaic pattern, which alternated with small lakes. The shores of reservoirs were occupied by reed and reed-sedge bogs. Increased mineralization was characteristic of the waters of endorheic lakes and soils along their banks. 
There is no centralized rain sewerage system in the city. Rain, melt, groundwater is collected in ditches and flows down them into natural and artificial reservoirs (pits), as well as into natural relief depressions in the city. In the off-season, excess surface water is partially transferred using mobile pumps from the center of the northern part of the city to the southern part, and then, through a dug channel, is diverted to Lake Gorodishche. Partially, surface runoff is discharged naturally and by force through ditches outside the central part and accumulates in depressions and ditches of the city's bypass roads. The total length of ditches in Isilkul is about 300 km, however, about 90 km require repair and deep cleaning, and about 24 km need to be re-laid. Also, in many places there are no roads or bypass pipes in a non-working condition. 
The reason for the periodic flooding of the city, along with the increased amount of precipitation, is the deterioration of the filtration properties of soils and soils, insufficient capacity and violation of the operating conditions of the drainage system. The predisposition of forest-steppe landscapes to secondary salinization, together with increased fluctuations in the level of groundwater, and their pollution with unorganized runoff, have caused excessive mineralization of urban soils. 
 
The discussion of the results 
Reconstruction of sewerage networks should become the top-priority measure to create a water-vegetable frame of the city. 
Expected result of the reconstruction of the drainage system: lowering the level of groundwater and reducing the risk of flooding of the territory; increased soil drainage and reduced concentration of soluble salts; improvement of the sanitary and epidemiological situation in the city. 
The reconstruction of the landscapes of the territory, the analysis of the transport infrastructure made it possible to propose a sectoral structure of forest plantations for Isilkul, in which the inner boundaries of the sections are forest protection belts of roads and railways. Forest parks in the form of strips and semicircles 300-600 m wide are planned to be laid in relief depressions at a distance of 1-2 km from the boundaries of the existing development (Fig. 4). 
A latitudinal strip of green zone will pass through the territory of the city. It will connect the existing squares and green sports grounds with the green recreational areas of the city center. Thus, a latitudinal vegetation corridor is formed, connecting the water-vegetation frame through the central territory of the city. 
Favorable places for planting in the modern landscape are marked by residual birch-aspen forests, lakes or swamps. Most often, these are waste lands that do not belong to agricultural land. In essence, it is proposed to carry out reforestation and form insular small-leaved forests of a given configuration, typical for the natural zone. At the same time, road belts, in addition to protecting soils from wind erosion, should strengthen the ecological unity of island forest ecosystems. The surveyed large forest areas in the west and north-west of the region are distinguished by the preservation of the indigenous flora and can be used to collect seeds of wild plants and select seedlings. The results of the study of natural and introduced flora made it possible to differentiate the species composition of future plantings according to optimal growing conditions and expand the list of species proposed for landscaping (Table 1-3). 
The water-vegetation urban framework will include lakes, natural and artificial runoff troughs, drainage ditches, suffusion depressions, as well as all areas occupied by vegetation (Fig. 3-4). 
The implementation of the program to create a water-green frame of the city will have a positive impact on the environment and comfort: 
- will lower the level of groundwater; 
- dry the territory of the city of Isilkul and the surrounding environs; 
- eliminates the flow of sewage into the lakes Gryaznovskoye, Gorodishche; 
- will significantly increase the comfort of living for city residents, which will contribute to the influx of people into the city of Isilkul and the Isilkul region as a whole. 
The supply of purified water to the lakes Kamyshlovo, Salt, Krivoe will increase the area of the water surface of these reservoirs, which will increase the production of fish products. Lowering the groundwater level, as well as abandoning the cesspool sewerage system, will make it possible to save money allocated for the removal of sewage by sewage trucks, annual flood control, and annual repair of flooded buildings and structures."
Screening of Macrophytes on the basis of Efficiency of Industrial Wastewater Treatment in Constructed Wetland,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2009488102c43e655e92fc28fc5109016a56df61,Pramod Kumar Mahish; Garima Madhariya,"Improper wastewater treatment and sanitation processes can negatively affect the environment and public health. Due to the problems with global water shortages, it is essential to take non-conventional water resources into account to facilitate the production of pure fresh water. To provide enough fresh water in the coming decades, wastewater treatment and recycling techniques will be crucial. Due to the limited availability of fresh water and over 70% of it is used for irrigation. Therefore, there is great potential for using recycled water for agricultural irrigation, particularly in cases where minerals like phosphorus and nitrogen are crucial for plant growth. Wetlands are shown to be one of the most suitable treatment options for reusing urban wastewater for irrigation in terms of pollution removal, with high reliability and energy required. Macrophyte species, substrate, hydrology, Surface flow rates, effective food systems, abundance of microorganisms, and temperature all play a role in wetlands ecology and efficiency in waste-water treatment. Organic matter can be effectively removed by constructed wetlands. The result showed that Pistia stratiotes, Alternanthera philoxeroides, Eichhornia crassipes, Polygonum persicaria, Ludwigia adscendens, Marsilea quadrifolia, Nymphoides cristata, and Ipomoea aquatica have the efficiency to reduce BOD up to 86.36%, 77.45%, 88.23%, 76.33%, 77.06%, 77.06%, 81.98%, 83.18%, and 78.26% respectively and COD removed up to 79.3%, 67.5%, 77.98%, 71.29%, 71.6%, 70.86%, 75.4% and 68.2% respectively In present study evaluated that Eichhornia crassipes have higher efficiency for contamination removal as compared to other seven macrophytes."

Статья представляет собой рецензию на книгу австралийского социального исследователя Инджи Джон «Города в эпоху антропоцена: новая экология и городская политика». В своей работе автор предлагает новый подход к разработке экологической политики, основанный на концепции антропоцена, в рамках которой природные явления рассматриваются как субъекты социальных отношений, что предполагает иное, отличное от традиционного инвайронментализма, понимание и измерение их последствий. Автор указывает, что в условиях современного состояния окружающей среды и слабой эффективности международных усилий по ее сохранению реальными площадками для активизации новой экологической политики, которые могут продемонстрировать роль «природы» в повседневной жизни человека и способствовать формированию экосознания и экокультуры, являются урбанизированные территории. Именно в городах возможна реализация концепции новой экологической политики, поскольку города как сложные социальные системы обладают рядом качеств, отличающих их от других пространственных образований, а именно интенсивностью социальных взаимодействий, их сложностью, непредсказуемостью и уникальностью. В качестве подтверждения своих теоретических выводов Инджи Джон приводит ряд примеров, демонстрирующих возможности предлагаемой ею концепции новой городской экополитики."

"Green Innovation, Carbon Storage and Perceived environmental quality in Lagos State University, Nigeria",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2040f655d8c89882412782fcc5cadaa3a9557faf,F. Ogundele; Ibiyemi Ibilola Olatunji-Bello; A. Adeneye,"A sustainable university has been defined as a higher educational institution that addresses, involves and promotes the minimization of negative environmental, economic, societal, and health effects generated in the use of their resources in order to fulfil its functions of teaching, research, outreach and partnership, and stewardship in ways to help society make the transition to sustainable lifestyles. Earlier studies on green innovations have basically centered on the environmental benefits and were purely descriptive in nature. Several others examined the effect of green innovation on soil organic carbon by comparing street trees of species. The present study would contribute to literature using a mixed research approach to empirically investigate the contributions of green innovation on carbon storage and perceived environmental quality in Lagos State University, Nigeria. Data for the study were obtained by collecting 100 surface (0 – 15cm) soil samples with the aid of a soil auger under campus trees, grasses, ornamental trees and vegetables (Amaranthus and green vegetable farms) across different land uses on campus. Also, data on green characteristics (tree height, tree size, canopy cover, density of herbs, basal cover and herbaceous cover) were measured using different ecological procedures, while 655 questionnaire copies were administered to staff and students to ascertain their perceived environmental quality of green innovation. Data obtained were analyzed using averages, simple percentages, One-Way Analysis of Variance, multiple regression analysis and principal components analysis. The results obtained showed that carbon storage significantly varied among the green innovation components with canopy cover contributing over 55% of carbon storage. The study revealed that canopy cover and tree size substantially contributed in carbon storage with canopy cover being more effective. PCA result identified beautification of LASU (19.8%), flood control (18.8%), promotion of urban ecology (15.8%) and improvement in air quality (9.5%) as the principal dimensions or perceived environmental quality of green innovation. The result further showed that green innovation characteristics have significant relationship with carbon storage. The study shows the importance of campus tree in carbon reduction and recommends the need for universities to give necessary recognition and incorporate these green components in physical planning."
From Urban Consumption to Production: Rethinking the Role of Festivals in Urban Development Through Co-Creation,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2045e4b45202496f3714531b7c1c655a29b7e7d0,Nicole Foster,"Festivals infuse art and culture into the physical transformation of public spaces to support economic development, social capital, and urban vibrancy. Although these impacts align with urban planning, these projects typically engage actors outside the field such as community organisations, businesses, and artists, reflecting cultural and creative economies, where different values, motivations, and practices are continually negotiated through processes of co-creation. However, institutional planning practices have not yet effectively engaged with cultural production processes to maximise the social, cultural, and economic impacts of arts-led development. To explore this potential, this research uses participatory, co-productive methodologies to analyse the Bristol Light Festival, a collaborative partnership between business interests, city staff, and creative producers. The article begins with a discussion of the often contradictory role festivals play in urban development, followed by a discussion of creative and cultural ecologies and an overview of the co-creation process. Drawing on festival participant survey and interview data, the article discusses how the festival generated new forms of belonging in the city and other impacts that are often invisible within dominant arts-led development strategies. The article concludes with a discussion of findings relating cultural ecologies and co-creation to urban planning practice."
"How do we feel, African Ornithology? A sentiment analysis search for symptoms of eco-anxiety",2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/204a09c7bbcecc136675c3a06a09bc89e17118f4,Alan T. K. Lee,"Ostrich is co-published by NISC (Pty) Ltd and Informa UK Limited (trading as Taylor & Francis Group) This year the Cape Gannet Morus capensis has been chosen as South Africa’s Bird of the Year. A beautiful coastal bird, I have seen these foraging in large flocks which give the impression they are common and doing well, and so it has been concerning to learn that the species is Endangered, with ongoing population declines on its island colonies. The population is under pressure for food resources, as well as from natural predators, as we learn in Strydom et al. (2022). Koopman (2022) quotes this text as a description from over 100 years ago: ‘The Malagash, as it is called by the Colonists, or Common Gannet of South Africa, frequents, in countless thousands, the whole of our coastline....’. It is certainly countable in 2022 and becoming more so with passing time with fewer and fewer to count. This is a depressing situation, and yet another unfolding ecological tragedy. Learning about Cape Gannet made me sad, but it is not the only thing. Unfortunately, it appears we live in ‘interesting times’ as per the alleged Chinese curse. The past two years have been torrid, and I suspect few have not been affected by inconvenience at least, or the loss of loved ones at worst, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. As I write, the situation in Europe is very unsettled with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. All this is set against the backdrop of climate change, with a mounting portfolio of associated disasters. Over the last decade we’ve also seen political polarisation, and a backlash against everything deemed to be too ‘left’, into which conservation initiatives are frequently lumped (Scholes 2013). In Africa, we are seeing the loss of natural environments to a combination of urban and agricultural expansion, ‘big development’, alien vegetation encroachment, human population pressure, climate change impacts resulting in floods, fires and droughts (Lees et al. 2022). We’ve seen the terms ‘eco-anxiety’ and ‘ecological grief’ coined to describe how people with a connection to nature now feel when faced with the loss of something very close to them, something with which there is a real emotional bond (Cunsolo and Ellis 2018). Grief is a powerful emotion: a rip in the fabric of our reality, but unlike grief felt with the passing of a loved one, ecological grief never ends: each tragedy is replaced by the next (Read 2022). The past two years has seen a lot of media attention on mental health. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that psychological suffering will outlast the coronavirus crisis, stating on 13 May 2020: ‘Even when the pandemic is brought under control, grief, anxiety and depression will continue to affect people and communities’. But how did we feel before and how do we feel now? Can we detect a changing pattern of sentiment in the titles and abstracts of some scientific journals? Although those should by their definition be dry and un-emotional, themes in conservation biology may not be, especially if they touch on topics related to extinction risk and environmental degradation. I attempt to answer these self-imposed questions through text mining and sentiment analysis. Text mining is the process of distilling insights from text. Sentiment analysis represents the set of tools to extract an author’s feelings towards a subject; an attempt at extracting an author’s emotional intent from text. It attempts to unlock the emotions from text in a quantitative manner. This article presents a sentiment analysis on the titles and abstract contents from a selection of journals which publish on African ornithology, as well as a set of comparison journals. Naturally, this article will focus on Ostrich: Journal of African Ornithology, but includes other ornithological journals, notably Bird Conservation International and Ibis, which also publish many articles related to ornithology from Africa, and often with themes related to conservation (Lee 2020). Likewise, African Zoology, although ornithological articles there are a minority. For comparison, I also examine the Journal of Avian Biology, which publishes on more dry-themed biological topics, Conservation Biology, and some control journals: Methods in Ecology and Evolution, and Afrika Matematika (expecting these last two to be neutral), and South African Journal of Psychology (expecting this to have more heavily weighted sentiment scores). The methods are in the Appendix 1. Perspective"
Dirty work in the clean city: An embodied Urban Political Ecology of women informal recyclers’ work in the ‘clean city’,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/204c505e9dc33054985e4f4a957a30e9f64af649,Josie Wittmer,"This paper investigates the ways that ‘cleaning up’ Indian cities impacts those who rely on accessing waste on city streets for their livelihoods. I focus on low-income Dalit women recyclers in Ahmedabad, India as they navigate material and discursive shifts in urban waste management emanating from the national Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and 2016 Solid Waste Management Rules, and the municipal privatization and mechanization of solid waste management practice. The study is informed by 10 months of ethnographic research and a series of interviews and group discussions with women recyclers between 2016 and 2018. Using a feminist embodied Urban Political Ecology approach, I suggest the imagining and production of the ‘clean and green’ world-class city is affecting Dalit women recyclers’ work in two ways. First, I argue that emerging cleanliness governance mechanisms and solid waste management practices are re-spatializing and masculinizing waste labour in the city. I show how spatial, discursive and temporal shifts in solid waste management are producing new challenges for Dalit women recyclers in accessing waste, intensifying their physical and financial burdens and requiring more precarious adaptations to generate daily incomes. Second, I explore women recyclers’ own clean city aspirations, expressing a desire to experience the ‘clean and green’ city and a simultaneous sense of betrayal as their livelihoods, communities and bodies are excluded from its imagining and material production. I suggest that an embodied intersectional analysis of waste labour reveals how the imagining and production of clean and sustainable ‘modern’ cities can cause damage to socially marginalized and gendered bodies as they are displaced from work and denied the substantive experience of urban citizenship in the ‘world-class’ city. Attention to embodiment thus deepens an understanding of the complexities and contradictions invoked in urban environmental governance and infrastructural transformations, informing the imagining and production of more equitable and reparative urban futures."
Assessing Net Environmental and Economic Impacts of Urban Forests: An Online Decision Support Tool,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2071074c49d3926d1198646fc69f5cd138bb3eaa,J. Babí Almenar; C. Petucco; Tomás Navarrete Gutiérrez; Laurent Chion; B. Rugani,"Nature-based solutions (NBS) are becoming popular in urban planning and policy making as cost-effective solutions capable of delivering multiple ecosystem services and addressing several societal challenges. So far, however, the cost-effectiveness of urban NBS projects has not been consistently quantified by built environment professionals, who lack user-friendly tools to account for the environmental costs and benefits of NBS. This paper presents a prototype online decision support tool (NBenefit$®) that calculates the negative and positive environmental impacts, externalities, and financial values of planned urban forests over their entire life cycle. NBenefit$ relies on a modelling framework that combines system dynamics, urban ecology, and life cycle thinking approaches, and it is presented as a visual web-based interface. An online map and a grid of cells is used to map the site of intervention, to delineate the size of the urban forest, and to define variations in abiotic, biotic, and management attributes in each site. Outputs are provided by year, for the entire site and NBS life cycle. The potential value of NBenefit$ as a supporting tool was exemplified with the calculation of 48 urban forest archetypes, a few of which were used to set scenarios for a hypothetical urban forest in Madrid (Spain). The results showcase the impact that decisions taken during the planning, design, or management of an NBS project may have on its long-term performance. Future works will expand the scope of NBenefit$, including other types of urban NBS."
Metagenomics: A Tool for Exploring Key Microbiome With the Potentials for Improving Sustainable Agriculture,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/209c0afbd4d691c7352aa59c819b2f463c0d1cfd,B. Nwachukwu; O. Babalola,"Microorganisms are immense in nature and exist in every imaginable ecological niche, performing a wide range of metabolic processes. Unfortunately, using traditional microbiological methods, most microorganisms remain unculturable. The emergence of metagenomics has resolved the challenge of capturing the entire microbial community in an environmental sample by enabling the analysis of whole genomes without requiring culturing. Metagenomics as a non-culture approach encompasses a greater amount of genetic information than traditional approaches. The plant root-associated microbial community is essential for plant growth and development, hence the interactions between microorganisms, soil, and plants is essential to understand and improve crop yields in rural and urban agriculture. Although some of these microorganisms are currently unculturable in the laboratory, metagenomic techniques may nevertheless be used to identify the microorganisms and their functional traits. A detailed understanding of these organisms and their interactions should facilitate an improvement of plant growth and sustainable crop production in soil and soilless agriculture. Therefore, the objective of this review is to provide insights into metagenomic techniques to study plant root-associated microbiota and microbial ecology. In addition, the different DNA-based techniques and their role in elaborating plant microbiomes are discussed. As an understanding of these microorganisms and their biotechnological potentials are unlocked through metagenomics, they can be used to develop new, useful and unique bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides that are not harmful to the environment."
Buscando Luciérnagas: findings on Mexican fireflies from an 8-year virtual citizen science project,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20a70c12e4f54d1b195070781ad39f7111bc3afa,E. del‐Val; A. M. Flores-Gutierrez; Regina González; Adrián Calleros,"Fireflies are charismatic and conspicuous animals that often evoke childhood memories, which make firefly watching an emotional and even transformative experience. Citizen science projects have the potential to enhance transformative interactions with nature. Like many insects, firefly populations are declining due to land-use change, urbanization and watershed pollution, but ecological data for this group is scarce, particularly in Mexico. Virtual Citizen Science (VCS) initiatives can serve as a scientific instrument, yield reliable and relevant scientific data, and may also offer a platform to promote broader educational outcomes. We established a VCS project to document fireflies through a Facebook page named Buscando Luciernagas with the following hashtag in every post #veobrillar in 2015. After seven years we complied the gathered data and analyzed the results. We had 647 reports in total, with strong fluctuations from year to year that were correlated with the number of posts and publicity we made each year. The largest number of sightings (319) occurred in 2021, coinciding with a change in our reporting format. Most of the reports came from central Mexico (91.5%), but we had reports from eight states and also received some international reports from nine different countries. Fireflies were most frequently seen in habitats characterized as grasslands (35%) or forests (27%), followed by gardens (17%), vacant lots (9%) and parks (5%) but also paved areas and agricultural lands were reported (3% each). Most citizen scientists reported few fireflies, 1–5 individuals (31%) while only 11% reported more than 50 fireflies per sighting. Our study can serve as a preliminary approach to explore more focused research areas in the future. For example, in areas with no sightings, we could reach out to specific local people to corroborate that there are no fireflies in the region, or in areas with high sightings we could promote conservation measures. Notably, we found it intriguing to discover numerous sightings of fireflies in urban areas, which could offer a potential avenue for further research in urban ecology."

The first chapter is about the myths, legends, histories and stories that strangely name the place as Jahazpur. As a ‘pitiless land’, Jahazpur’s story travels far both in time and space. The second chapter – ‘Entries’ – is about five and a half gates that let us enter the city. Each of these gates has its unique ways of life attached to them that mirror the town’s sociability, economy, and religiosity. The third chapter starts outside the town core; outside the gates to Santosh Nagar, where Grodzins had spent most of her stay. The chapter celebrates the intimacies and emotions that build upon an ethnographer in the field. From the highly nuanced reading of the third chapter, we are suddenly into the banal everyday life of the streets in the fourth chapter. This chapter is basically intertwined with the religious expressions that need streets as their space. The fifth chapter is about Minas and Jains, who have their respective historical geographies in the town. Titled as ‘Depths’, this chapter unearths the histories that are shrouded. The second part of the book entangles human activities and their implications. In continuation, the sixth chapter situates itself amid efforts to afforestation, tree protection and restoration of the river. The seventh chapter is wholly based on observation; it deals with the preparation, event and post-event life worlds of Bhoju Ram’s daughter’s wedding. Bhoju Ram and his daughters are collaborators and co-creators of her ethnographic outcomes. Again, the final chapter moves from periphery to the center – the market in its very unusual way. The town has built itself centering on this market. While inhabiting the everyday negotiations, this substantive chapter questions the business and morality and how they come together in this pitiless land. The book ends with an epilogue that sees Jahazpur as a ‘bloom space’ (278). Having completed her fieldwork in 2011, the author has returned to it repeatedly in the virtual realm and thrice in real. The speed with which the space is blooming made her awestruck. More emotive is the end paragraph that connects it to her self, when she explains how acquaintances have left Jahazpur after 2011, rendering it as ‘not a final destination’ (285) for themselves, like her. The book intrigues, teaches and queries the limitations as we flow with the text. Grodzins’ scholarship is demonstrated in ethnographic engagements that produce absorbing stories. With its selfinflicted inferiority complex, the town is juxtaposed to the nuances and complexity of everyday life. The de jure banality in parallel to de facto everydayness is highly intriguing and inviting. The book adds to our knowledge on qasba (between urban and rural settlement) life in the wake of ever-proliferating research on small towns in India. More importantly, the author has produced a highly sophisticated urban ethnography of the global south with its reversed and emphatically acknowledged periphery-centre question."
The Effects of Soundscape Interactions on the Restorative Potential of Urban Green Spaces,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20bd4dacb672e79edf6061ea2e59bb40ec51c300,Xinhui Fei; Yuanjing Wu; Jianwen Dong; Deyi Kong,"From the perspective of landscape environment and human health, this study introduces the concept of soundscape from soundscape ecology. Through two experiments evaluating the restorative properties of soundscapes, it analyzes and compares the differences in restorative benefits among various sounds in urban green spaces. The study further explores the effects of single soundscapes and combined soundscape types on environmental restorative benefits and provides recommendations for creating restorative soundscapes in urban green spaces. The main findings of this study are as follows: (1) Sound types significantly influence soundscape restorative benefits, with notable interactions observed among three single soundscape categories. Significant differences were also found in the restorative effects of different combined soundscapes. (2) The most restorative sounds for anthropogenic, biophonic, and geophonic soundscapes are light background music (1.4193), bird sounds (1.9890), and flowing water sounds (1.2691), respectively. The least restorative sounds are vehicle noise (−2.6210), conversation sounds (−0.8788), and thunder sounds (−0.7840). (3) Significant differences exist between the restorative effects of single and multi-level combined soundscapes. Except for bird sounds, the general restorative pattern is as follows: two-level combined soundscapes > three-level combined soundscapes > single soundscapes."

The Orgeval catchment is representative of intensive agriculture (80 % of its total area), the main land use in the Seine river basin. For more than 50 years, both quantity and quality of water are monitored throughout the catchment, from sub-hourly to yearly time scales. This rich dataset allows improving the understanding of critical zone structure and reactivity, in a holistic and interdisciplinary approach. Specific basic and applied research topics relate to extreme hydrological events, agricultural tile drainage, land use planning, and more generally the evolution of agricultural activities facing climate change and urban growth.
 The Orgeval research observatory is a unique testbed to investigate the functioning and evolution of the Critical Zone. Multidisciplinary approaches are implemented thanks to collaborations between research institutes and universities, combining knowledge and methods from different disciplines, such as hydrology, ecology, biogeochemistry, geophysics and socioeconomics. Created in 1962, the observatory was initially devoted to study floods and weathering research questions. Since then, is evolved towards other societal and environmental topics. Initiated in 1975, lots of monitoring and research was dedicated to diffuse agricultural pollution, especially nitrates, which contributed to a better understanding of the interactions between agricultural activities and surface and groundwater quality. Since the 2000’s, research questions opened to pesticides and biology and biodiversity. The Orgeval observatory is also highly adapted to develop technological innovations, such as in situ biochemical monitoring.
 A multi-scale observation strategy is implemented in both space and time, ranging from local (with more than 80 monitoring sites) to regional scale, and from time-lapse campaigns to high-frequency measurements (from 1 Hz for geophysics to 1 h or 1 week for chemistry), most often with a long-term approach. The main measurements include:
 
 
 
 Water level and water discharge: at the outlet of each sub-catchment.
 
 
 groundwater level: in piezometers in the riverbanks and in the aquifers.
 
 
 Precipitation: in addition to Météo-France stations.
 
 
 Main weather variables: air temperature, humidity, and radiation.
 
 
 Soil moisture: from the soil surface to a depth of 1.5 meters.
 
 
 Water quality: dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, dissolved gases (O2, CO2, Rn), major and trace ions, nutrients, but also water, carbon or strontium stable isotopes. This includes the RiverLab prototype, installed in June 2015 at the outlet of Avenelles sub-catchment for high-frequency measurement (every 30 minutes) of the river's chemical composition.
 
 
 Organic and inorganic contaminants: pesticides but also metals and microplastics in surface and groundwater.
 
 
 Ecotoxicological and ecological indices: ecological assessment.
 
 
 Surface and groundwater temperature: using heat as a tracer of surface-groundwater exchanges.
 
 
 Hydrogeophysics: ERT, GPR, seismic, especially in the riparian areas.
 
 
 Borehole core samples and logging: lithofacies description and characterization.

Shades of grey: Coat-colour dependent effect of urbanization on the bacterial microbiome of a wild mammal,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20d8aa590a23d09e9dcafa15f0aab6fff282d7eb,Mason R. Stothart; A. Newman,"Background Host-associated microbiota can be fundamental to the ecology of their host and may even help wildlife species colonize novel niches or cope with rapid environmental change. Urbanization is a globally replicated form of severe environmental change which we can leverage to better understand wildlife microbiomes. Does the colonization of separate cities result in parallel changes in the intestinal microbiome of wildlife, and if so, does within-city habitat heterogeneity matter? Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we quantified the effect of urbanization on the microbiome of eastern grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). Eastern grey squirrels are ubiquitous in both rural and urban environments throughout their native range, across which they display an apparent coat colour polymorphism (agouti, black, intermediate). Results Grey squirrel microbiomes differed between rural and city environments; however, comparable variation was explained by habitat heterogeneity within cities. Our analyses suggest that operational taxonomic unit (OTU) community structure was more strongly influenced by local environmental conditions (rural and city forests versus human built habitats) than urbanization of the broader landscape (city versus rural). Many of the bacterial genera identified as characterizing the microbiomes of built-environment squirrels are though to specialize on host-derived products and have been linked in previous research to low fibre diets. However, despite an effect of urbanization at fine spatial scales, phylogenetic patterns in the microbiome were coat colour phenotype dependent. City and built environment agouti squirrels displayed greater phylogenetic beta-dispersion than those in rural or forest environments, and null modelling results indicated that the phylogenetic structure of urban agouti squirrels did not differ greatly from stochastic phylogenetic expectations. Conclusions Habitat heterogeneity at fine spatial scales affects host-associated microbiomes, however, we found little evidence that this pattern was the result of similar selective pressures acting on the microbiome within environments. Further, this result, those of phylogeny-independent analyses, and patterns of beta-dispersion lead us to suggest that microbiota dispersal and ecological drift are integral to shaping the inter-environmental differences we observed. These patterns were partly mediated by squirrel coat colour phenotype, and therefore putatively, host physiology. Given a well-known urban cline in squirrel coat colour melanism, grey squirrels provide an ideal free-living system with which to study how host genetics mediate environment x microbiome interactions."
Research on the Coupling Relationship Between Park and Metro Station Space in Qingdao,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2119bab04872d3f195645dabbef2f0c62243750b,Peng Dai; Lufang Bi; Shi Cen; Guannan Fu; Hui Fang; Yanjun Wang,"As indispensable elements of public space in the city, metro stations and parks have the dual characteristics of “node” and “place”. Based on the “node–place” theoretical framework, the spatial evaluation and detailed classification of Qingdao metro station is carried out by integrating ArcGIS technology and diversified data sources. On this basis, an innovative metro station spatial coupling evaluation model is constructed, which takes into account the station carrying capacity, park accessibility, land use degree, and other factors, while evaluating the economic and environmental benefits. This study deeply explores the complex coupling relationship between the surrounding metro stations and park space in Qingdao. According to the results of the evaluation model, corresponding strategies for different types of station space are proposed. By taking measures, such as focusing on fine development strategies, stimulating the vitality of stations and implementing guided renewal, and enhancing the mutual suitability of rail transit and surrounding park space, the great potential of combining green ecology with urban space optimization is demonstrated."
City in Africa II: Urban environmental health,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/211ef02cae1d64b6bd9627d20b757caad18974a0,P. Cobbinah,"African cities are confronted with severe environmental health challenges, such as declining green space, poor housing conditions (slum formation and growth), pandemics and epidemics (e.g., COVID-19, Ebola), pollution (air, water, and soil), traffic congestion, conflicts, and violence, which are aggravated by unplanned urbanization and climate change (Cobbinah & Addaney, 2022). The quality of the urban environment faces many threats as the natural ecology is under intense pressure from demands generated by rapid urbanization. With half of the continent’s population projected to live in cities by 2030, considerable environmental health challenges are negatively impacting public health and productivity across African cities. Similarly, climate change is exacerbating urban environmental health risks and producing inequalities in African cities by augmenting the rate and gravity of extreme weather events including heatwaves and floods, unsettling the urban ecosystem (UN-Habitat, 2022). For example, the urban heat island effect intensifies heat stress in cities and produces environmental health risks. Yet, urban citizens’ knowledge of climate change is dimly appreciated in the literature. While African cities are complex and diverse, understanding the diversity of and responses to critical urban environmental health issues is important for improving environmental quality and human well-being. This special issue, “City in Africa II: Urban Environmental Health,” draws on an emerging body of research on environmental impacts of climate change and rapid urban population growth and responses in African cities, including urban citizens’ understanding of climate change, urban heat island effect, green space management, local activism and quality of life, housing, and urban insecurity. It further responds to calls for “African” framing and solutions to advance sustainable and improved urban environment (see Cobbinah & Finn, 2022; Currie & Musango, 2017; Rogerson, 2016). Since the turn of the 21st century, there has been mounting evidence demonstrating the vulnerability of the urban environment across African cities reflected in their incapacity to adequately address and adapt to the outcomes of rapid urbanization and climate uncertainty. The latest World Cities Report published in 2022 indicates that: “dealing with future risks—including environmental risks—has become one of the main concerns for local governments and other urban-based actors, eliciting diverse responses” (p. xxii). As future urban growth of the world will take place mostly in Africa, where the planning systems and state agencies are least equipped to address associated urban environmental challenges (UNHabitat, 2022), the need for a deeper understanding, concerted action and substantial response has also grown. While there is an important and emerging body of research on urban environmental health, more is required to understand the diversity across the continent and inform the level of response required in African cities. As has frequently been argued, Africa’s urbanization is one of the fastest in the world, and this increasing concentration of population in cities requires well-informed and significant action to improve the urban environmental health and to adapt to emerging environmental risks. In developing this special issue, attempts were made to ensure a variety of research, policy, and practice topics in relation to urban environmental health across the continent.

Palma-Oliveira; Mónica Mendes,"Urban culture has encouraged participatory art practices that focused on human interaction and social contexts. At the same time, urbanization has induced a disconnection between Human-Nature interaction and the development of mental models detached from complex social-ecological systems and their sustainability. This article is part of a PhD research relating Digital and Interactive Arts with Ecology and Psychology. Our aim is to investigate participation in documentary film production and explore it as a participatory artistic medium to foster critical thinking towards Sustainability. Hereof, in this article we set the grassroots from which our research will evolve. We first analyse participation in the process of filmmaking, through the engagement of the subject-participant in documentary creation and production both in linear films and in i-Docs (interactive and immersive documentaries). We then associate the speech of these subject-participants to mental models concept. Next, we introduce the sustainability principles that will guide our investigation in urban social-ecological contexts and set some inspirations raised by previous artistic practices. We then discuss the intersections between aspects of participation in documentary films with mental models and sustainability to finally set out interrogations and possibilities for future artistic explorations that ponder on participation, authorship, technology, cognitive dimensions, social-ecological systems and dissemination towards sustainability."

Religion and urban political eco/pathology: exploring communalized coronavirus in South Asia,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/215a6ecc3868ef8b9296ca1536c0012e0a2f25ed,Asif Mehmood; S. Hasnain; Muhammad Azam,"ABSTRACT
 wWe use the urban political ecology perspective to explore how communities of homo religiosus (re)configure politics of COVID-19 in India and Pakistan. This urban health crisis unfolds in five parallel registers of conflictualities: (i) where religious communities carve out a domain for self-governance of the pandemic with their own ‘knowledge and truths’, (ii) where embodied religious practices challenge or undermine state biopower and transform governmentalities, (iii) where the spatial dimension of conflict evolves into the crisis of technologies of governance, (iv) where religious identities are stigmatized and the minority groups are excluded and (v) where communalism organizes around international relations. It is argued that religious groups in South Asia influenced the urban political (eco)pathology with their disruptive potential which transformed biosecurity regimes and enhanced health risks on the one hand and on the other, they embraced and internalized discords of disease within their antagonistic communal and sectarian memories and histories and weaponized the pandemic to produce more cracks in the social fabric. This essay underscores the significance of unusual actors in the urban political ecology framework and calls for a renewed understanding of human–nature interface by incorporating religion and religious beliefs and how they view and shape the metabolic flows in the urban spaces for social sustainability of the city as a ‘natural object’."
Moving in the Dark—Evidence for an Influence of Artificial Light at Night on the Movement Behaviour of European Hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus),2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/215db0acd80f4ba7911ee1ee5321cd997e13eb0f,A. Berger; Briseida Lozano; L. Barthel; Nadine Schubert,"Simple Summary The European hedgehog is one of the most popular and well-known wild animals, but its numbers are declining throughout Europe, especially in rural areas. Effective hedgehog conservation requires an understanding of the hedgehog’s ability to adapt to a changing environment. Due to globally increasing urbanisation, the use of artificial light sources to illuminate the night, called light pollution, has spread dramatically. Light pollution significantly affects the behaviour and ecology of wildlife, but the hedgehog’s behaviour towards light pollution remains unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of light pollution on the natural movement behaviour of hedgehogs living in an urban environment. Although hedgehogs can react very variably to environmental influences, the majority of hedgehogs studied here preferred to move in less illuminated rather than in strongly illuminated areas. This apparently rigid behaviour could be used in applied hedgehog conservation to connect isolated hedgehog populations or to safely guide the animals around places dangerous for them via dark corridors that are attractive for hedgehogs. Abstract With urban areas growing worldwide comes an increase in artificial light at night (ALAN), causing a significant impact on wildlife behaviour and its ecological relationships. The effects of ALAN on nocturnal and protected European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are unknown but their identification is important for sustainable species conservation and management. In a pilot study, we investigated the influence of ALAN on the natural movement behaviour of 22 hedgehogs (nine females, 13 males) in urban environments. Over the course of four years, we equipped hedgehogs at three different study locations in Berlin with biologgers to record their behaviour for several weeks. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) tags to monitor their spatial behaviour, very high-frequency (VHF) loggers to locate their nests during daytime, and accelerometers to distinguish between active and passive behaviours. We compared the mean light intensity of the locations recorded when the hedgehogs were active with the mean light intensity of simulated locations randomly distributed in the individual’s home range. We were able to show that the ALAN intensity of the hedgehogs’ habitations was significantly lower compared to the simulated values, regardless of the animal’s sex. This ALAN-related avoidance in the movement behaviour can be used for applied hedgehog conservation."
Digital transformation of the sphere of life as a basis for the growth of social value,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2168d05492f25ad6b2769d988f2c2102b93b1214,O. Berestetska; Nataliia Riznyk,"The Covid-19 global pandemic has pushed the world to develop a digital economy. The processes of digital transformation do not bypass any sphere of human life and activity in Ukraine: there is a need to do business online; there is a need for remote work; increased opportunities for distance education. In order to reap the benefits of digitalization in all areas of application, it is important to use appropriate digital tools, which in turn helps to create high added value for the state, increase the efficiency of the economy and business and as a result lead to economic and social impact. The article reveals the connection between digital transformation and social value. Since each person lives in a separate system of values, objects and phenomena that are designed to meet all its needs, and can be involved in certain areas of life, such as economics, law, ecology, medicine, pedagogy, sports, art, all this and forms social values. That is, social value is the significance of phenomena and objects of reality in terms of their compliance or non-compliance with the needs of society, social groups or individuals. We get used to the fact that any service can be obtained without leaving home, using a smartphone, by electronically signing documents generated in the same smartphone, so we can easily move to activities and life in the virtual world (online). The article considers digital transformation projects that have already become popular among the citizens of Ukraine, as well as analyses the provision of households with fixed access to the Internet in urban and rural areas, which is a necessary condition for providing opportunities to use relevant services. The availability of websites of enterprises for certain types of economic activity was traced and the possibility of providing interactive services through it was studied, which really increases the possibilities of using digital services and increases the company's profits. The modern world of technology is rapidly evolving, so the digital transformation is an irreversible and endless process, and social values will always be relevant in the new conditions in which society will live and work."

Gemmell; Jordan Thomas; Eleanor G. Bentley; Mark Whitehead; W. Paxton; G. Pollakis; S. Paterson; M. Viney,"Wild animals are naturally infected with a range of viruses, some of which may be zoonotic for humans. During the human COIVD pandemic there was also the possibility of rodents acquiring SARS-CoV-2 from people, so-called reverse zoonoses. To investigate this we have sampled rats (Rattus norvegicus) and mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) from urban environments in 2020 during the human COVID-19 pandemic. We metagenomically sequenced lung and gut tissue and faeces for viruses, PCR screened for SARS-CoV-2, and serologically surveyed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibodies. We describe the range of viruses that we found in these two rodent species. We found no molecular evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, though in rats we found lung antibody responses and evidence of neutralisation ability, that are consistent with rats being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and / or exposed to other viruses that result in cross-reactive antibodies."

Hradoboyeva,"The article explores the possible ways of managing ecological security of the city based on the use of economic methods and legal tools. It was determined that the urbanization has a negative impact on the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to make decisions on managing ecological security of the city. The management of city’s ecological security includes both functional (planning, organization, financing, coordination, control) and situational (decision-making to stabilize the environment in emergency and crisis situations) aspects. In this case, the corresponding economic methods and legal tools are used. They aim at motivating or forcing the economic entities to plan and finance environmental protection measures in the city. To do this, the methods of economic regulation (taxation, lending, subsidizing, provision of subsidies and benefits, imposition of fines) are used. The economic methods are included in the economic mechanism for managing the ecological security of the city. This mechanism is connected with the legal mechanism for regulating environmental protection activities in the city. The legal mechanism includes legal tools (legislative acts, industry regulations, decisions and orders made by local authorities) for managing environmental security. The choice of economic methods and legal tools depends much on internal and external factors, principles of distribution of responsibility for caused environmental damage, the need to coordinate the interests of the process actors with the management of ecological security of the city. To promote environmental safety in the city the environmental projects, environmental cooperation, and environmental entrepreneurship are of great importance. Their implementation and development are carried out using the economic methods and legal tools. At the same time, both the environmental assessment of projects and the assessment of social consequences of the decisions are made. Besides, the changes in the economic and legal regulation of economically safe development of the city also should be justified on economic grounds. The most important condition for this is the coherence of economic methods and legal tools. This coherence is possible due to the availability of information support, the development of which should become the subject of further research.

"Ferals and gentrification in urban Australia: place, death and memory",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21aaa576edd501e54c03f3b52861d5e51634b87a,Duncan McDuie-Ra; Kate Senior,"ABSTRACT In the city of Newcastle on Australia’s east coast, murky distinctions between feral and native, public and private, domestic and wild are being delineated and firmed as the city rapidly gentrifies. The suburb of Stockton, a peninsula with deep working-class roots, has long been considered an urban frontier, a liminal zone for plants, animals and humans. Here, ferality is entangled with place, with frontier-ness. As the area undergoes changes in step with gentrification in Newcastle and coastal Australia more generally, species once tolerated are being identified as risky and then eliminated. In this article, we focus on two feral species subject to elimination in Stockton, the Thorn Tree and the Breakwater Cats. We argue that shifting nature-city boundaries impacts urban frontiers during periods of gradual, then rapid, gentrification, disrupting the relationship between frontiers and feral ecologies. Second, while literature tends to focus on feral plants or animals, we consider the ways that hardening nature-city boundaries can make both plants and animals vulnerable to elimination. Third, despite their elimination, the Thorn Tree and the Breakwater Cats are subject to memory practices in the community, suggesting that even as the urban frontier amalgamates with the rest of the city, memories of feral co-habitants remain for some members of the human community."

Sudhakar; Kumar Sahoo; Anantha Raman,"The Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) catalyzes this investigation, which dives into the complex relationship between genomes and the surrounding environment. It monitors various environmental factors in real-time using a distributed network of Internet of Things sensors installed across various natural and urban locations. While doing this, this system collects genomic data from creatures that live in or interact with these habitats. This allows us to explore the intriguing dynamics of genetic adaptation in response to environmental changes. The research sheds light on the genetic factors responsible for an organism's capacity to flourish in constantly changing environments. The system can shed light on patterns of genetic mutations, disease prevalence, and variations in biodiversity by integrating environmental data collected from the Internet of Things with genomic information. These realizations contribute to our comprehension of the mechanisms that drive evolution; help create conservation plans for species at risk of extinction, inform disease epidemiology, and assist sustainable farming practices. The article ""IoT-Driven Genomic Ecology"" demonstrates a multidisciplinary approach to converging genomics, environmental science, and IoT technology. Its purpose is to shed light on the underlying principles that control life's adaptability to a world that is always changing."

The relevance of the theme lies in the contribution to sustainable urbanism, aligning with biophilia, with benefits for living beings, including humans, with better walking conditions, thermal and psychological comfort. The general objective of the work was to delineate an urban ecological corridor in the continental portion of the city of Vitória/ES, in order to connect three isolated Environmental Protection Zones and benefit their essential occupants: the human species, the flora and the fauna. Exploratory studies and field visits were conducted, supported by Urbanism and Ecology literature, based on the definition of the connection axes and the recomposition of road profiles. The result achieved is an ecological corridor adapted to the existing roads, from the intensification of forestation and the implementation of gantries and elevated walkways for animal crossings. The insertion of aerial crossings and biodiversity corridors will bring a differential to the quality of life and ecological diversity for the local population."
Endogenous Growth in a Spatial Economy: The Impact of Globalization on Innovations and Convergence,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21bd0e2fe5a3879aa53070cd7d91a1f07bfb82ec,Dani Broitman; D. Czamanski,"In this article we explore the claim that spatial interactions among cities are significant drivers of their growth. We assert that reallocation of ideas among cities is a source of improved allocation of resources. We propose a closed economy, agent-based model that is in constant flux. It is populated by autonomous agents that compete and adjust constantly their behavior in reaction to the conditions they perceive. The economy is a dynamic, self-organizing system. We focus on the intensity of globalization as the critical economic process that explains differences in convergence and divergence in the system. The means by which the extent of globalization affects the long-run performance of economies is the geographic reach of new ideas and their conversion into innovations. The question that plays out in our model is the relative influence of globalization and the localized entrepreneurial ecology on innovation. When the globalization is weak, new firms are limited by the market value of their own city. As the globalization strengthens, more and more new firms belong to the global playground. We demonstrate that in line with empirical literature, the gross domestic product of our urban system increases greatly with the increase in globalization level."

Zaykova,"The project novelty of the world’s urban development trends is associated with new approaches to the organization of the modern human life environment. Issues of integrated development of territories with the organization of different types of public spaces in the natural environment are solved at different urban planning levels. Residential and office clusters with new forms of socio-cultural and recreational scenarios represent a modern design in which objects do not have visible borders between nature, architecture and the human environment. This is a new type of hybridization of a building with an environment where nature and technology, education and entertainment, history and modernity combine and complement each other. On the other hand, increasing risks on the planet from floods, hurricanes, fires and droughts force specialists to adapt to these changes and learn how to control them through new design technologies. Therefore, the emergence of “hybrid objects, blocks and spaces” is not accidental and is associated with a change in perceptions about the level of environmental sustainability and comfort of living for people of different ages and social status in large cities. Depending on the social order and location in different parts of the city, hybrid facilities have a strong impact on environmental change when using green building technologies and offer citizens a variety of activities in a harmonized environment. They have a powerful scientific resource in working on the aesthetics and ecology of the city, as their typological structure affects the indicators of environmental sustainability by forming a new green and blue infrastructure of the city. Due to the high interest of specialists, hybrid objects and spaces deserve careful study, as they affect not only the quality of the urban environment when using the tools and technologies of architecture, landscape and design, but also the issues of urban management and climate change in the near future."

It was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1994, with identified threats being residential and urban development, including lack of protection on private land and lack of management on public lands, competition with invasive non-native plants, and risks of extinction associated with small and isolated populations. Our goal in this paper is to summarize and supplement the current knowledge of Morro manzanita. We review the literature on the species' description, reproductive ecology, germination cues, short-term response to fire. and distribution. We conducted field surveys to report on long-term response to fire, resampling the previously studied prescribed burn site 25 yr post-fire. Finally, we summarize the current land management of sites that support Morro manzanita and threats faced by this species. We conclude with specific recommendations for management and future study towards supporting conservation of this species and its maritime chaparral community."

Research procedures include determining evaluation factor criteria, data collection, weighting criteria using the Analytical Hierarchy Process, preparing tree species suitability evaluation equations, and determining the level of suitability of tree species in each area. The research produced equations for evaluating the suitability of tree species in: a) jogging track= 0,16.B + 0,48.M + 0,07.E + 0,29.K, b) river border= 0,20.B + 0,24.M + 0,05.E + 0,50.K, c) playground= 0,11.B + 0,28.M + 0,14.E + 0,46.K; where: B = biomorfology-ecology characteristic factor score, M= management factor score, E= aesthetic factor score, and K= health factor score. The tree species most suitable on the jogging track area are breadfruit and cotton fruit. The leucaena, june plum, and jackfruit trees have high suitability at the river border. Rain, butterfly, gnetum, frangipani, and matoa are very suitable."
ECOLOGICAL REVITALIZATION ASPECTS OF ABANDONED INDUSTRIAL TERRITORIES AS A WAY OF STABILIZING THE ECOLOGICAL SITUATION ON POST-SOCIALIST KIEV SPACE,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21e19d58166b4a16c46606cd7a22a168baa22f85,K. Osypenko; Yuliia Tarabanova,"In the XXI century, the city began to lose its appeal to people: the accumulation of elements of the artificial material world in the form of buildings and structures, increasing the number of abandoned industrial areas, the sharp deterioration of the environmental situation contributes to anti-urban trends and urban depression. Today there is an urgent problem of harmonization of human life and society in relation to the natural environment, so began to emerge architectural trends and currents, the main concept of which - unity with nature. But for the implementation of such projects aimed at stabilizing the ecological situation of the urban environment, the need for development of new territories has increased. In these conditions, the interest of depressed industrial urban enterprises is understandable, which can be fully included in the architectural environment of the city and adapted to the needs of modern society. Revitalization has become an important component of the new paradigm of renewal of the territorial space of Kyiv as a post-socialist city. 
It is established that in modern cities there are almost no free territories that could be used to increase the area of public spaces, landscaping and the formation of landscape and recreational areas. Attention began to attract degraded industrial areas - areas of the city, which under the influence of social, economic, political factors have lost their purpose, are not used for their original purpose and are abandoned. Former industrial areas have great urban potential. And the secondary use of degraded industrial buildings with the subsequent eco-revitalization of the surrounding space helps to simultaneously solve the problematic issues of economy, ecology and aesthetics in the process of city life. 
The article considers the concept of ""ecorevitalization"" as one of the elements of sustainable urban development policy aimed at preventing the development of urban areas, development of social and economic activities, ecological improvement of the environment and analyzes the ways of ecorevitation. It is established that landscaping is a search for ways to integrate wildlife with the artificial environment of human life."

This work examines the characteristics of the general-interest written press as a vehicle for unintentional learning about music by the public at large. The first objective of the study was to identify the formal characteristics of the musical content messages found in the general-interest written press. The second objective was to analyse the type of music-related messages disseminated by the press in relation to its sociocultural links. The methodology used was both quantitative and qualitative, applying both to analyse the content. The data source consisted of 60 weekend pull-outs found in three of the most widely read newspapers in Spain, covering a six-month period of data collection. The results indicate that it is possible to create a taxonomy of informal music learning that the press can promote in the general population. This learning is strongly shaped by variables related to the socio-cultural context surrounding it, giving rise to trends towards the dissemination of content more related to general aspects of popular urban culture than to music itself."

Steadily increasing urbanization and the abandonment of traditional agricultural activities led to a rapid erosion of local environmental knowledge (LEK). We conducted 40 semi-structured interviews in Padua, one of the most industrialized areas of Italy, to identify changes and drivers of change in plant foraging. We documented the use of 56 plant, fungal, and animal taxa, including the most foraged Humulus lupulus, Silene vulgaris, and Papaver rhoeas. These are mainly prepared in risottos, frittatas, and boiled mixtures. During their lifetime, 68% of the interviewees redirected their foraging area, 25% completely abandoned their foraging practice, and 7% abandoned foraging but resumed it after retirement. Changes in the foraging area and foraging abandonment were mainly driven by increased pollution and lack of land accessibility, as well as partially related lifestyle changes and (micro)climate change. In the face of such changes and with the aim of re-establishing the connection between peri-urban communities and their land, some local committees are struggling to take back the unused spaces of the industrial area and prevent future loss of land accessibility and consequent loss of LEK."
Car Pooling System,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/222e30580cf6a1f099b66e8e447c7ca9172fc344,N. Kirthiga; R. Mohan; P. V. Gowthami; V. Jaswanth; P. S. Kumar Reddy,"Traffic jams, pollution, and wasteful use of resources are just a few of the transportation-related issues that have arisen as a result of urbanization. Adapting sustainable transportation networks is crucial to address these issues, and carpooling is one of the most important tactics in this effort. To support the development of a sustainable transportation ecology in metropolitan areas, this abstract provides a thorough foundation for a carpooling system. Utilizing contemporary technology such as GPS monitoring, data analytics, and mobile applications, the suggested Carpooling System maximizes vehicle occupancy and reduces travel times by pairing drivers and passengers in the most efficient way possible. Ride-sharing experiences are made easy and convenient by the system's integration of user preferences, including routes, departure hours, and passenger compatibility. To further ease traffic congestion, minimize carbon emissions, and encourage the economical use of transportation resources, the Carpooling System was created with sustainability as its primary goal. The approach promotes widespread adoption and involvement by offering incentives like cost-sharing and awards for eco- friendly behavior. The Carpooling System not only improves the environment but also the social and economic spheres by increasing social connections, encouraging community involvement, and saving consumers money on commuting. The concept helps create more inclusive and resilient metropolitan communities by encouraging a shared mobility culture. The importance of including carpooling in the larger context of sustainable urban mobility is generally highlighted by this abstract. A realistic way forward for livable, equitable, and ecologically conscious cities in the face of rising urbanization and transportation issues is provided by the suggested Carpooling System, which embraces innovation, technology, and cooperative efforts."
"Ecology of Red-Tongue Viper (Gloydius ussuriensis) in Jeju Island, South Korea",2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22357b48b6066d44967297044f9a0c2ed235f747,Hong-Shik Oh; M. Banjade,"Understanding the ecology of species at risk is extremely important for their conservation and management. Due to land clearing for urban expansion, agriculture, and the import of pets, several snake species including the red-tongue viper (Gloydius ussuriensis) on Jeju Island of South Korea, have become threatened. We studied morphology, distribution, habitat characteristics, diet, and reproduction of red-tongue viper to provide a higher understanding of species ecology. This species on average reach 242–580 mm snout-vent length and is found in a wide range of habitat from mountain forest to lowland areas. Adult snakes prey almost entirely on amphibians followed by mammals and centipedes. The mating usually takes place in spring and birth takes place in autumn. This study points out the major threats and ill-information if addressed will not only contribute to the conservation efforts but also improve the negative attitudes that people hold toward these fascinating animals. The ecological data of G. ussuriensis herein provides basic information which assists in designing the management technique for conservation. Similar applications may be generalized and used to other vulnerable species to detect and quantify population ecology and risks, bolstering conservation methods that can be used to optimize the efficacy of conservation measures."

However, bringing researchers and resources together across fields and countries is challenging. Therefore, an online collaborative research hub, where common methods and best practices are shared among scientists from diverse geographic, ethnic, and career backgrounds would make research focused on urban evolutionary ecology more inclusive. Here, we describe a freely available online research hub for toolkits that facilitate global research in urban evolutionary ecology. We provide rationales and descriptions of toolkits for: (1) decolonizing urban evolutionary ecology; (2) identifying and fostering international collaborative partnerships; (3) common methods and freely‐available datasets for trait mapping across cities; (4) common methods and freely‐available datasets for cross‐city evolutionary ecology experiments; and (5) best practices and freely available resources for public outreach and communication of research findings in urban evolutionary ecology. We outline how the toolkits can be accessed, archived, and modified over time in order to sustain long‐term global research that will advance our understanding of urban evolutionary ecology."

Erigeron floribundus and other Erigeron species of the Former Genus Conyza in the Municipal Area of Aachen,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2258439826606da955d66a23f8035d0305c6942c,F. Bomble,"Currently, four widely distributed Erigeron species of the former genus Conyza are distinguished in western and central Europe: E. bonariensis, E. canadensis, E. floribundus and E. sumatrensis. A record of a plant of the up to now in Germany apparently unknown E. floribundus in Aachen-Laurensberg gives reason to describe characters, ecology, and distribution of the four species in the urban area of Aachen and other regions. E. floribundus, which combines characters of E. canadensis and E. sumatrensis on the whole, seems to be a very rare exception in Germany at the moment, but will probably spread fast from Belgium and the Netherlands. Besides the frequent E. canadensis are E. bonariensis and E. sumatrensis rapidly spreading species and are naturalized in some areas of western Germany. Meanwhile, E. sumatrensis is widely distributed in Aachen as well as in other parts of the Rhineland and regionally quite frequent. E. bonariensis is scattered especially in urban areas in Aachen and other parts of the Rhineland."

 <p>Since its creation in the late 1990s, UNISDR has identified education and knowledge as priority factors for risk and disaster reduction, notably through Hyogo and Sendai frameworks for actions. More recently, the 2019 Assises Nationales des Risques Naturels (a major meeting event organized by the French Ministry of Ecology on the natural risks management) have pointed out the urgent need to develop a risk culture to improve the resilience of territories. One of the levers for developing this risk culture is to inform the population of the risks to which they are exposed. Preventive information can take a wide variety of forms: regulatory brochures, exhibitions, plays, etc. However, we can wonder about the impact of this information: is it effective? Does it reach its objectives? How to evaluate its influence?</p><p>In a geographical context where few natural disasters occur, questionnaire surveys can be a solution. However, several studies have shown that this method fails to put individuals in a situation of emergency and to project themselves into a potential event that they may have difficulties to imagine. This is why the I&#178;PRI project proposes to go beyond these methods and develop innovative and immersive tools to assess the impact of preventive information on people's knowledge. The project developed both a video game and a play. The objective of these media is to immerse the respondents in a fictive but realistic disaster situation in order to evaluate their ability to mobilize their knowledge in the case of a real event. Those tools are based on a common scenario that aims at putting the respondents in a dilemma situation. They mobilize an artistic dimension and raise the question of how to transcribe natural events through sound and visual stimuli or through interactions with other characters. Each tool has an observation and a debriefing phase which allow not only to analyse the respondents reactions but also to assess the efficiency of the whole protocol.</p><p>Applied to two phenomena (fast kinetic floods and earthquakes), the survey has been carried out in six municipalities of the French Alps. Those municipalities are characterized by different geographical contexts (urban/rural, plain/mountain) and different preventive information contexts (old information, regulatory information, alternative information). The talk will present the two protocols and the first results of their deployment in the field: the results of the survey about the level of information of the population, the side effects of the protocols in terms of preventive action, and the action-based research process in terms of public action of preventive information.</p>

"The Elasticity of Space in Karen Tei Yamashita’s ""Tropic of Orange""",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22618158615fc17d0bfa9cdd893f81a853e50281,Miloš Blahút,"Karen Tei Yamashita’s novel Tropic of Orange is a study of space shaped by history, urbanism, globalisation, and ecology. Yamashita explores the social injustice, urban, and environmental changes happening in postmodern and futuristic Los Angeles through seven characters and their respective storylines, narrated by various narrators with different styles. Most characters experience spatial and temporal distortions in their everyday lives, allowing them to try to understand the events unfolding around them. Yamashita depicts space as an organic, changeable, and elastic unity. I argue that by viewing space more holistically, Yamashita offers solutions to some of the overarching problems California has been facing for a long time, namely racism, displacement, class differences, transformation of urban space, violence, and the threat of ecological catastrophe. The convergence of space and time in the narrative, mixed with magic realist tropes, enables Yamashita to interrogate and critique the contemporary socio-economic conditions of the Latin American community in Los Angeles."

Bloom,"The coronavirus pandemic is a vivid reminder of just how interconnected the world is. Global populations are united by a shared vulnerability to this invisible virus, just as they are by the unseen causes of climate change. COVID-19 and the climate crisis, too, have exposed the deep structural inequities among low-income populations and communities of color, disparities that put these populations at a significantly higher risk to both crises. Today, due to globalization, dense urban population growth, and disruptions in the ecosystem, humans are more vulnerable to viruses than at any other time in history. Through an examination of these intersecting relationships, this chapter looks, first, at the biology of coronaviruses, followed by the ecology of human and animal environments, and, last, at the sociology of health disparities. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, J.

A Subject-Oriented Historical GIS (the Example of Barnaul Infrastructure in the Late 18th – Early 20th Centuries),2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/227e477b3643ed569b1b3f8024a14265e7157d62,V. Vladimirov; E. Krupochkin; Dmitrii Evgen'evich Sarafanov,"
 The article studies the infrastructure of Barnaul city in the second half of the 18th - early 20th centuries. The study aims at acquiring new systematic knowledge about the way the infrastructure of West Siberian cities developed, the influence of infrastructural objects on city ecology, the correlation of demographical and ecological factors influencing the city development and urban population reproduction. The study rests on an extensive source database including written, cartographic and photo documents stored mainly in the state archives of Altai Krai and Tomskaya Oblast as well as a number of published sources. The methodological basis of the work is the systemic and interdisciplinary approaches, the general scientific as well as traditional historical research methods. Geoinformation analysis based on the subject-oriented historical geoinformation system created is used as the main way to obtain new information. The article analyzes spatial aspects of the city infrastructure and ecological factors of its development and demonstrates changes in the disposition of infrastructural objects in the late 19th – early 20th centuries. The article concludes that the negative impact of ecologically unfriendly city objects was exerted mainly through aggravating sanitary environment and ecosystems.

A New Approach for Understanding Urban Microclimate by Integrating Complementary Predictors at Different Scales in Regression and Machine Learning Models,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2289691aaaef07e0c4f7265de392372c711e3b36,L. Alonso; F. Renard,"Climate change is a major contemporary phenomenon with multiple consequences. In urban areas, it exacerbates the urban heat island phenomenon. It impacts the health of the inhabitants and the sensation of thermal discomfort felt in urban areas. Thus, it is necessary to estimate as well as possible the air temperature at any point of a territory, in particular in view of the ongoing rationalization of the network of fixed meteorological stations of Météo-France. Understanding the air temperature is increasingly in demand to input quantitative models related to a wide range of fields, such as hydrology, ecology, or climate change studies. This study thus proposes to model air temperature, measured during four mobile campaigns carried out during the summer months, between 2016 and 2019, in Lyon (France), in clear sky weather, using regression models based on 33 explanatory variables from traditionally used data, data from remote sensing by LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), or Landsat 8 satellite acquisition. Three types of statistical regression were experimented: partial least square regression, multiple linear regression, and a machine learning method, the random forest regression. For example, for the day of 30 August 2016, multiple linear regression explained 89% of the variance for the study days, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of only 0.23 °C. Variables such as surface temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) have a strong impact on the estimation model. This study contributes to the emergence of urban cooling systems. The solutions available vary. For example, they may include increasing the proportion of vegetation on the ground, facades, or roofs, increasing the number of basins and water bodies to promote urban cooling, choosing water-retaining materials, humidifying the pavement, increasing the number of public fountains and foggers, or creating shade with stretched canvas."

Valuing plants in devalued spaces: Caring for Baltimore's Street trees,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2290ad703d53e861fe04db9b2469e93c25eca639,Mariya Shcheglovitova,"Baltimore City, MD is addressing its future with expansive sustainability initiatives. These include an aggressive tree planting campaign to double the city's tree canopy by 2037. While discourses of greening present tree plantings and related programs as a resolution for the legacies of racist housing market practices, these programs are themselves subject to the legacies of spatial inequalities in access to infrastructural care. Sustainability discourses present urban trees as inherently valuable economically and environmentally but these discourses are disconnected from trees' needs for ongoing care and maintenance. The daily material practices of caring for and maintaining trees are deprioritized in favor of planting more trees to gain these supposedly “inherent” benefits. In the spaces where trees were meant to bring economic and environmental vitality, their deaths reinforce the racist legacies they claim to correct. This paper examines these links and contradictions within the framework of relational urban political ecology. Through a lens of care, this paper shows how humans and non/humans actively co-construct urban space and how just spaces can come about through attention to the needs of humans and non/humans."
Integrating Sponge City Concept and Neural Network into Land Suitability Assessment: Evidence from a Satellite Town of Shenzhen Metropolitan Area,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22948b0e926ecffd8386f63f0452e84f3ec5125a,Keyu Luo; Zhenyu Wang; Wei Sha; Jiansheng Wu; Hongliang Wang; Qingliang Zhu,"Land suitability assessment is fundamental in space control planning and land development because of its effects on land use and urban layout. Rainstorms and waterlogging have become one of the most common natural disasters in the coastal areas of China. As a result, the concept of an ecological sponge city was incorporated into the construction of cities in the future. Taking Shenzhen–Shantou special cooperation zone (SSCZ), we constructed a storm flooding model based on the SCS flow generation model and GIS to explore the spatial distribution characteristics of the flooding risk in a rainstorm of 100-year lasting 1 h. Combined with population and economic indicators, a radial basis function (RBF) network was utilized to evaluate the environmental risk, the vulnerability of disaster-bearing bodies, and the rain–flood resilience of sponge cities. The self-organizing feature mapping (SOFM) model was used for cluster analysis. Spatial differences were found in the construction suitability of the study area. A suitable construction area (73.59% of the entire area) was located downtown. The construction of the artificial spongy body in the highest vulnerable area (3.25%) needs to be strengthened. The control construction area (3.3%) is located along the banks of the river, with relatively high risk and low resilience of flood control engineering. Ecological construction (19.85%) serves as the sponge body of ecological buffer. The factors of waterlogging, ecology, population, and economy could be integrated comprehensively by applying neural network methods for urban planning and construction."
Agroforestry: The North American Perspective,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/229a52786d976c89b67a6f569a53b56554a81780,S. Lovell; H. Garrett,"Agroforestry has a long, rich history that is rooted in activities practiced by indigenous communities around the world. Native peoples were known to gather fruits, nuts, and understory herbs from the forest, based on their deep ecological knowledge of the natural system, and they often cultivated preferred species. For modern applications, agroforestry can be defined as the intentional integration of trees and shrubs with crops or livestock to create a multifunctional system with a wide range of benefits. In temperate regions, agroforestry is characterized by six key practices: (1) alley cropping—planting rows of trees with a companion crop grown between the rows; (2) forest farming—growing high-value specialty crops in the shaded forest understory; (3) riparian buffers—protecting water resources such as streams with a zone of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants; (4) silvopasture—combining trees, forage, and livestock for multiple products; (5) windbreaks—planting rows of trees and shrubs to protect crops or livestock from wind and to reduce soil erosion; and (6) urban food forests—integrating trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants that provide edible products for the good of the community. The environmental benefits of agroforestry have been widely studied and continue to be a source of great interest. Most recently, the potential for agroforestry to contribute to climate change adaption and mitigation is being explored. While the science of agroforestry has been influenced to a great extent by the field of ecology and related disciplines, social science dimensions are increasingly captured through the study of adoption behaviors, preferences, and cultural benefits. The investigation of the role of economic and policy drivers is critical to understanding strategies to motivate landowners to adopt these practices at a level that would expand agroforestry into the mainstream. Landscape-level planning and design could provide a vision and a pathway for a broader transformation to a system that encourages perennial habitats including specialty crops that supply edible products. Such a strategy could place agroforestry more directly into the growing call to support regional food systems and positive human health outcomes. This article focuses on the trends and directions in agroforestry research primarily in North America, with emphasis on developments in the early 21st century."

By using the Yinchuan Plain urban wetlands in the Yellow River Basin of China as a case study, their ecological health status from 2000 to 2020 was systematically evaluated by integrating information from remote sensing technology, geographic information technology, field sampling, information entropy (IE), a landscape index, and a Comprehensive Evaluation Index. The results show that the restoration and protection of wetland ecosystems have achieved remarkable results in the Yinchuan Plain. The wetland ecological health index has significantly increased from 0.26 to 0.67, which is an increase of 157.7%, and the health level increased from poor (II) to sub-healthy (IV). Factors restricting the healthy development of wetland ecology in the Yinchuan Plain include wetland construction, investment, population density, the number of tourists, and fertilizer use. The research results show that the wetland restoration and protection have achieved specific environmental, economic, and social results in the Yinchuan Plain. However, we also need to pay attention to increasing the investment in wetland environmental governance, strictly controlling the intensity of land use and the total amount of chemical fertilizer applied in various regions, scientifically carrying out wetland restoration and protection, reasonably coordinating the relationship between environment and society, and providing technical and decision-making support for wetland management and protection. This study provides a reference for the ecological governance and sustainable development of wetlands in large river basins worldwide."
Urban population structure and local movement ecology of a native Australian mosquito involved in disease transmission,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22ab645dbf3fdde1966b11c6a77d3505a6d5e8a9,V. Paris; R. Rane; P. Mee; S. Lynch; A. Hoffmann; Thomas L. Schmidt,"Successful species management is reliant upon understanding key ecological features of the target species and the environment. Dispersal is a critical factor to assess when designing control measures as it determines the rate of migration out of or into controlled areas and influences the risk of human exposure to the species and its pathogens. This study uses spatial population genomics to investigate the movement ecology of Aedes notoscriptus, an important disease transmitting mosquito, at the Mornington Peninsula, Australia. We sampled Ae. notoscriptus eggs from the Mornington Peninsula at a single time point, and generated genomic data from 240 individuals from different locations. We also produced a draft genome assembly for this clade of Ae. notoscriptus. We used genomic data to detect close kin dyads, and the locations of dyads showed that specific acts of movement in the previous generation had occurred over distances >1 km. We also investigated isolation by distance patterns from the spatial autocorrelation of genetic distances. Significant genetic dissimilarity in Ae. notoscriptus began to be observed at >4 km separation, a fourfold higher distance than in a comparable sample of the dengue mosquito Ae. aegypti. These findings are evidence that the high mobility of Ae. notoscriptus influenced the success of a 2021 mosquito control trial at the Mornington Peninsula, because the dispersal ability of Ae. notoscriptus was likely to have exceeded the size of the intervention zones which were designed around ecological knowledge of Ae. aegypti. Further sampling within the same area was used to obtain counts of Ae. notoscriptus eggs at two timepoints 6 and 12 months after initial sampling. We found egg counts to be consistent across timepoints, and spatial variation in egg counts was found to covary with spatial variation in neighbourhood size (NS). As NS increases linearly with population density, this is evidence that egg counts may be useful for estimating relative density in Ae. notoscriptus. The overall results of this study draw attention to the importance of acquiring species-specific data when planning control measures, and contribute to the fundamental ecological understanding of this important vector species."

We incorporate the estimated residence-mobility matrix into a multi-patch compartmental SEIR model to assess the effect of mobility changes due to governmental interventions."
POTENTIAL THREATS OF PERI-URBAN TUONG-MANGO PRODUCTION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTHY AGRICULTURE FOR HEALTHY ECOSYSTEMS,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22d95795f67330bcde34ba7ddc064c096fd1bc3b,T. Kiet; Pham Thi Hoan Nguyen; Nguyen Thi Kim Thoa,"Understanding both positive and negative influences of urban agriculture (UA) could encourage countries to have suitable strategies in UA development, especially in developing country’s cities. The study used the environmental impact quotient (EIQ) model to identify potential risks of agro-inputs usage on urban ecosystems (human and ecology). The paper concentrates on influencing agrochemicals on farmers, consumers and ecosystems in Tuong-mango cultivation in the peri-urban area of southern Vietnam. The results show that nitrogen fertilizer plays an important role in mango production but it can cause nitrate poisoning in the surrounding community, and is especially dangerous to infants, pregnant women (birth defects and miscarriages) and adults (stomach and esophageal cancers). In addition, the fungicide makes up the highest proportion of the total agro-inputs usage. The findings indicate that active ingredients of the paclobutrazol, mancozeb, probineb, ziram and carbenazim are high in Tuong-mango cultivation in southern Vietnam. Paclobutrazol and ziram are category II (moderately hazardous), and the mancozeb, probineb, carbendazim are in the list of category U (unlikely to present acute hazard when in regular use). Besides, the ecosystem EIQ triple the farmer EIQ, are fivefold the consumer EIQ for the seasons 1, 2, and 3. The field use EIQ average value of season 1 is the highest, followed by season 2, and season 3 is the lowest. For policy solution, stakeholder reference and policy dialogue should be discussed regularly before UA is carried out in cities. Sustainable progression of UA in cities require coordination between health, agriculture and environmental departments, education and training. Moreover, urban farmers need to be supported in technical advice, training, credit access, and collection economic development."

Joseph; Eda Mumo; Camille Morlighem; P. Macharia; Robert W. Snow; Catherine Linard,"Growing concerns about mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) in urban settings have prompted renewed urgency for collaborative and active mosquito surveillance programs. This literature review collates entomological data from five East African Community (EAC) countries, studying the definitions of urban settings, co-occurrence of Anopheles, Aedes and Culex mosquito genera and their infection rates to provide a wholistic understanding of MBDs in urban EAC.A literature search following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines was conducted in EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases to identify entomological studies conducted in urban and peri-urban settings since 2000. Data on urban and peri-urban settings definitions, presence records and infection rates of Aedes, Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes were compiled and presented.A hundred and five articles were included in the review. Diverse definitions of urban landscapes emerged, emphasizing (i) distinct characteristics for dichotomous delineation from rural settings (e.g., population density) and (ii) urban-peri-urban continuum integrating spatial variations in urban features associated with MBDs (e.g., planned/unplanned neighbourhoods). Mosquito ecology data derived from 88 sites, comprising 45 urban, 25 peri-urban, 14 mixed settings and four slums, reported 91 mosquito species, including 32% Culex, 31% Aedes, and 25% Anopheles genera. Other co-occurring genera, such as Coquillettidia and Mansonia, represented 12% between 2000 and 2024. Intricate co-occurrence patterns among Aedes, Culex and Anopheles genera linked to habitat preference and climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation) were observed. The average infection rates were estimated as 0.8% for yellow fever, 0.9% and 1.1% for urban and peri-urban P. falciparum sporozoites respectfully, 2.7% for Dengue, 5.3% for Chikungunya and 6.02% for flavivirus, indicating co-circulation of arboviruses among mosquito population.Our synthesis presents an overview of the complexities of urban MBD research over the past two decades. Integrated assessment of MBDs dynamics in rapidly evolving urban environments is crucial to achieving healthier urban environments in East Africa.https://osf.io/a6s9j/."

 A clothing-optional / cruising beach in rural Victoria, Sandy Beach also known as Somers Beach, exemplifies how the queer body’s navigation of space responds to complex ecological, urban, and social conditions. A queering of architectural definitions allows this site to be researched as a historically significant urban/architectural site of social and environmental value. 

 It is suggested that the subtle yet complex practices of site transformations enacted through occupation are an architecture of environmental connective possibility. ‘Queered’ corporeality orientates the body and material practices towards assemblages where boundaries between humans and nature are transgressed, ultimately constituting a ‘queer ecological architecture’

Coping with novelty across an urban mosaic: Provisioning latency increases closer to roads and is associated with species-specific reproductive success in two urban adapters.,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2306bf0c9dc9fc38f46f8f765c9e17d02da2a2bf,M. Corsini; Pietro Leanza; A. Rodewald; Joanna Sudyka; A. Dhondt; Marta Szulkin,"Most research on urban avian ecology has focused on population- and community-level phenomena, whereas fewer studies have examined how urbanization affects individual behavioral responses to a sudden and novel stimulus, and how those translate to fitness. We measured between-individual variation in provisioning latency in two urban adapters - great tits and blue tits - in response to an infrared camera installed in the nestbox, encountered when offspring in the nest were at the peak of food demand (9-10-days old). For each nestbox, we quantified urbanization as intensity in human activity, distance to road and proportion of impervious surface area. In both species, provisioning latency increased significantly closer to roads. Moreover, increased provisioning latency when exposed to a novel object was associated with higher reproductive success in great tits whose nestboxes were surrounded by high amounts of impervious surface. In contrast, increased provisioning latency was consistently associated with lower reproductive success in blue tits. Our results suggest that provisioning latency changes in relation to the environment surrounding the nest, and may be context- and species-specific when exposed to a novel stimulus, such as a novel object in the nest. To better understand the role of initial behavioral responses towards novelty across an individual's lifetime and, ultimately, its impact on fitness in the urban mosaic, further research explicitly testing different behavioral responses across the entire breeding cycle in wild model systems is needed."
"Urban Turtle Project: Using Citizen Science to Document Freshwater Turtle Communities and Populations in Birmingham, Alabama, with Focus on Alabama Map Turtles (Graptemys pulchra)",2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23080420e7f908f2b9decc76d2fff72b04f0ec18,A. Coleman,"Abstract. Long-term data sets are critical in assessing populations of long-lived species such as turtles. The Urban Turtle Project was initiated in 2018 to begin building a long-term data set on the demography and ecology of the turtle populations in various urban waterways of Birmingham, Alabama. Another goal of the project is to increase public awareness of the state's impressive chelonian diversity by employing citizen scientists on semiannual sampling weekends. In its 2-yr existence, 52 participants volunteered over 200 hrs during 4 sampling weekends, with 16 volunteering for multiple weekends. Over 200 turtles of 10 species were sampled, with the majority of captures (n = 83) being Alabama map turtles (Graptemys pulchra), a historically understudied species. Collected demographic and reproductive data contribute to a better understanding of natural history of G. pulchra and how this and other species exist in an urban environment."
Political Ecology Evaluation of Waste Management Policy in Banjarmasin City,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/230ff6709f9e1d9855beeaf79e2bd2b5c2c245f6,Hendra Hendra; D. Arisanty,"Rapid urbanization in Banjarmasin City has intensified domestic waste management challenges, posing a significant obstacle to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to urban environmental governance. Despite the enactment of Regional Regulation No. 21/2011 promoting the 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) principles, its implementation remains fragmented and has failed to engage comprehensive community participation. This study adopts a political ecology framework to critically assess the effectiveness of the policy, emphasizing structural barriers such as institutional fragmentation, limited technological adoption, and imbalanced stakeholder power relations. A qualitative case study approach involved in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, document analysis, and field observations. Thematic analysis and triangulation methods were used to validate findings. Results indicate Banjarmasin's waste governance remains largely technocratic and top-down, with inadequate grassroots integration and weak inter-agency coordination. Technological innovations such as digital monitoring and Waste-to-Energy solutions are notably absent, further limiting policy outcomes. This study highlights the urgency of reforming local waste governance through participatory, equitable, and technologically adaptive strategies, particularly for medium-sized cities in the Global South."

Research on the Influence of the Integration of Public Art and Computer on Urban Culture from the Perspective of Media Ecology,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/232f4afc4808a782d77c553342c80c466c1e8d2a,Siyu Lu,"With the deep integration of computer technology and public art, the digital characteristics of public art become more and more obvious[1]. The digital public art takes the public environment of the city as the carrier, which occupies every corner of the city and develops steadily. The diversified performance media and all-round sensory experience make it an alternative public art with unique expressive force. At present, the manifestation of digital public art tends to be diversified, and its influence on urban culture is more and more profound and complex. Therefore, from the perspective of Media Ecology, this paper explores the characteristics of public art in the computer age. On this basis, this paper analyses the impact of public art integrated with computer technology on urban culture, which provides a new thinking direction for the harmonious development of public art and urban culture."

But while urban areas now stretch across latitudes, little is known about urbanization’s effects on macroecological patterns. We used standardized experiments to test whether urbanization disrupts latitudinal gradients in seed predation, a macroecological pattern that shapes community assembly and diversity. Using >56,000 seeds, we compared predation in urbanized and natural areas across 14,000 km of latitude, spanning the Americas. Predation increased 5-fold from high latitudes to the tropics, and latitudinal gradients in predation persisted in urban areas despite significant habitat modification. Urbanization reduced predation by vertebrates, but not invertebrates, and seemed to increase ant predation specifically. Our results show that macroecological patterns in predation intensity can persist in urbanized environments, even as urbanization alters the relative importance of predators. One-Sentence Summary Across 56,000 seeds and 112° of latitude, latitudinal gradients in seed predation are equally strong in natural vs. urban areas"
Urban ecological life in a metropolitan area—an insight from Satoyama conservation activities in the Greater Tokyo Area,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/234ad077268a269d6a749646e3f3edab14f83c02,Naomi Shimpo,"Urban residents need to live in an ecologically sustainable way to mitigate and adapt to climate change. To discuss the model of urban ecological life, this paper focused on Satoyama landscapes and reviewed academic articles on the existing cases of Satoyama conservation by urban residents in the Greater Tokyo Area. We analyzed activities performed by participants, benefits to participants, and targeted and achieved ecosystems. Several findings were obtained from the review of published literature. First, the participants were mainly elderly men aged 60 years or older, who were not necessarily local people and who were motivated mostly by the need to conserve nature and improve their health. People with intellectual disabilities also enjoyed the benefits of Satoyama woodland management. Second, participants tended to recognize benefits in terms of health promotion, social cohesion, recreation, and resource utilization, rather than landscape and biodiversity conservation. Third, there were different directions of Satoyama conservation from the perspectives of nature and humans. The broader ecosystem beyond each site was not necessarily considered in Satoyama conservation. These findings show the potential of, and the necessity for, attracting other urban residents by including various activities that consist of not only vegetation conservation but also communal events based on different preferences. There is also a need for balancing environmental and socio-economic perspectives, and the targeted ecosystem should be further explored in collaboration with experts in ecology and landscape planning to make urban ecological life feasible."
Contextualizing Conceptual Foundations: Educational Citizenship Curriculum Development in Chiang Mai Peri-Urban Schools,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2358ae576a10484feb74a226e882516242088171,Panadda Pananil; Nongyao Nawarat; Omsin Jatuporn; Panadda Rerkplian,"This article forms part of the dissertation on Development the English Language Curriculum Base on Culturally Relevant Pedagogy for Students in Chiang Mai Peri Urban Area. In this paper, I  analyze data collected from a school and its community in a peri-urban area of Chiang Mai to understand better the cultural context for curriculum development of a migrant population.  The paper synthesizes general and practical concepts within a cultural context to provide a better foundation for developing curricula for creating educational citizenship for learners in the suburbs of Chiang Mai.  Specifically, this paper aims to: 1) present general concepts for developing a curriculum framework for creating citizenship for grade 8 students in a suburb of Chiang Mai; 2) present operational concepts in the daily life of secondary students to understand better how these concepts affect their practical lives both within in the school, and the larger suburban community. 
The researcher employed a phenomenological, qualitative methodology, including data from documents and observations of various school and classroom activities.  Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted with key informants, including three teachers, twenty-three students, and five parents from October 2021- February 2022.  To test for accuracy and reliability, the researcher used methodological triangulation. The results revealed that educators could transform contextual concepts at both general and practical levels into foundations for a curriculum framework for educational citizenship at two levels: 1) the general contextual concept, which is a physical environmental issue; migration and loss of community are all affecting the learning ecology of learners in classrooms and schools in suburban areas, where these learners are new educational citizens who live at the seams   2) Contextual concepts at the practical level become practical in everyday life because of the Community Cultural Wealth (CCW) capital knowledge within the learners, culminating in the family-specific contexts and suburban community areas in which the learners lived and grew up. The operation from CCW knowledge capital is, therefore, support--or scaffolder–to create hope and encouragement for meaningful and valuable learning for learners. Furthermore, it facilitates the setting of goals for living for oneself and negotiating with the expectations or demands that clash with the family and surrounding society.
The conceptual consideration of the contextual conceptualization from the general concept to the relationship with the concept of the operational level can create conceptual foundations for defining the components of the curriculum framework development to create educational citizenship, which is: a comprehensive learning concept with spatial facts and correlation with the social background and cultural wealth of the learner's community. As a result, the curriculum implementation aims to develop life skills for coexistence with others and a broader understanding of social relationships."

Molecular ecology and risk factors for third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli carriage by dogs living in urban and nearby rural settings,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/235ea2957ee21f87d5ac89de2c87cc3aaf839bf5,J. Sealey; A. Hammond; O. Mounsey; V. Gould; K. Reyher; M. Avison,"Abstract Objectives To compare faecal third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GC-R) Escherichia coli isolates from dogs living in a city and in a rural area ∼30 km away; to compare isolates from dogs, cattle and humans in these regions; and to determine risk factors associated with 3GC-R E. coli carriage in these two cohorts of dogs. Methods Six hundred dogs were included, with faecal samples processed to recover 3GC-R E. coli using 2 mg/L cefotaxime. WGS was by Illumina and risk factor analyses were by multivariable linear regression using the results of an owner-completed survey. Results 3GC-R E. coli were excreted by 20/303 rural and 31/297 urban dogs. The dominant canine 3GC-R ST was ST963 (blaCMY-2), which also accounted for 25% of CMY-2-producing E. coli in humans. Phylogenetic overlap between cattle and rural dog CTX-M-14-producing E. coli ST117 was observed as well as acquisition of pMOO-32-positive E. coli ST10 by a rural dog, a plasmid common on cattle farms in the area. Feeding raw meat was associated with carrying 3GC-R E. coli in rural dogs, but not in urban dogs, where swimming in rivers was a weak risk factor. Conclusions Given clear zoonotic potential for resistant canine E. coli, our work suggests interventions that may reduce this threat. In rural dogs, carriage of 3GC-R E. coli, particularly CTX-M producers, was phylogenetically associated with interaction with local cattle and epidemiologically associated with feeding raw meat. In urban dogs, sources of 3GC-R E. coli appear to be more varied and include environments such as rivers."
Exploring Dendroflora Diversity and Ecology in an Urban Arboretum from Western Romania: The Role of Plant Life-Form and Plant Family in Urban Woody Phytocoenosis,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2362866acc8d15921bbef1491c7ddbe8e6c2e5ca,Madalina Iordache; Laurentiu Zamfir; A. Becherescu; A. Chis,"The dendroflora of an urban arboretum (The Botanic Park of Timișoara, Romania), consisting of 193 species, was ecologically characterized as bioforms, phytogeographical elements, and preferences for moisture, temperature, and soil pH. The aim of the research was to determine whether the native ecological requirements of the woody species, along with certain biological and evolutionary traits of them, such as plant life-form and plant family, could serve as tools for explaining and understanding the strategies employed by the urban woody phytocoenoses to acclimate and adapt to an established environment, such as an urban arboretum. The inventoried species are grouped in 111 genera and 45 families. The native and non-native dendroflora share 16 common families. The most representative family both in the native and non-native dendroflora is Rosaceae. The monotypic families are largely present (22.22% in the native dendroflora, and 42.22% in the non-native dendroflora). The plant life-form spectrum is dominated by megaphanerophytes (49%), followed by mesophanerophytes (41%). The chorological spectrum of the native species comprises 16 chorological types and is dominated by Eurasians (32%) and Europeans (30%). The species characteristics of the Pontic-Carpathian space, to which Romania belongs, are rare in the analyzed urban botanical park (4%). The mesophyte, mesothermal and slightly acido-neutrophilous species dominate both the native and non-native dendroflora. In the acclimation process of the non-native dendroflora, 37% of species exceeded their native requirements for moisture, 41% for temperature, and 50% for soil pH. The species requirements for temperature are associated to those for moisture and soil pH. The results show the potential of the analysed woody species to exceed their native requirements within the acclimation and adaption process, and in this process, for the studied temperate site, the plant life-form is important, and also the plant family. The species of the analyzed urban arboretum, both native and non-native, are taxonomically and biogeographically diverse, with specific habitat requirements, suggesting their great ability in acclimating, adapting and resisting."
How does space matter? On the importance of embedding spatialities in industrial ecology frameworks for circularity in the built environment,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2367ca6757a15a90955914657ce8213e32989e46,G. Schiller; Xiaoxue Gao; M. Lanau; A. Blum; Ning Zhang; M. S. Çıdık,"This paper explores the critical role of spatiality and scale in industrial ecology (IE) research to promote circularity within the built environment. Traditional IE frameworks are predominantly a‐spatial and a‐political, overlooking the complex socio‐ecological–technological dynamics of urban–regional environments. This gap limits the development of holistic assessments and effective strategies for circularity, often externalizing political, economic, and societal implications. In this paper, we emphasize the need to integrate diverse spatial entities, such as social actors, natural resources, and infrastructure, into IE frameworks. Drawing on recent developments within the IE community (including insights from the ISIE 2023 conference) we demonstrate how multiple spatialities and politics are already integral to several areas of IE research and practice, such as circularity accounting and industrial symbiosis. We highlight how spatial concepts—such as urbanization patterns, geographic features, territory, place, and actor‐networks—reveal context‐specific drivers and barriers to circular transformation. We then leverage the concept of scales established across spatial sciences to introduce a typology of scales relevant to IE, and identify which scale types have yet to be operationalized in IE research. Given the potential analytical yield of each scale type, we advocate for a reflective multi‐scalar approach to incorporate multiple spatialities into IE research. Ultimately, we call for a spatial turn in re‐conceptualizing IE tools to support the transformation of the built environment toward circularity."
Spatiotemporal Characteristics and Decoupling Effects of Urban Construction Land Expansion in Plateau Basins,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/237da3987047552fdb033fda28c68d4d221a6dbf,Yi Zeng; Tashi Lobsang; Xingyun Luo; Zhengxin Zhang; Hengyi Yang; Xiaoqing Zhao,"The expansion of construction land is a key feature of urbanization. Understanding its spatiotemporal evolution in Yunnan’s plateau basins is crucial for minimizing resource waste and promoting coordinated regional development. This study employs land use and nighttime light data to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of construction land expansion and its decoupling from economic growth, using various indices and the Tapio decoupling model. The results reveal a steady rise in urban construction land from 1990 to 2020, characterized by significant spatial variations in expansion speed and intensity. Edge expansion predominated throughout all periods, accounting for over 50% in most regions. After 2010, expansion spread into smaller basins, markedly increasing the number of areas experiencing new expansion. The decoupling between construction land expansion and economic growth in these basins remains primarily weak and unstable, indicating a strong reliance on land for economic development. Factors such as socioeconomic conditions, geography, ecology, and policy influence both land expansion and economic growth, highlighting the interdependence between the two. These findings provide a foundation for sustainable basin development and offer valuable insights for planning and policy-making."
Ecological Quality Response to Multi-Scenario Land-Use Changes in the Heihe River Basin,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/238c203e99fee81e90f8b83957c2d992e5491e43,Shengtang Wang; Y. Ge,"To investigate the spatial-temporal effects of land-use changes on ecological quality and future trends, an integrated framework combining the Dyna-CLUE model and the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) was developed. Land-use changes from 2000 to 2035 were simulated and projected under the current trend scenario (CTS), economic development scenario (EDS) and ecological protection scenario (EPS) in the Heihe River Basin, while the RSEI was predicted using the elastic net regression (machine learning method); finally, the predicted results were synthesized and analyzed. The results showed that forest, grassland and water were positively correlated with ecological quality, with the green space coverage under the CTS, EPS and EDS accounting for 34.15%, 70.65% and 34.72% of the total transferred land area, respectively. The increase in the area of build-up land and unutilized land was detrimental to ecological quality, with the area of building land in the EDS being 1.75 times larger than in the year 2000. The EDS contributes to the sustainable development of the upstream area and the EPS is more conducive to the midstream and downstream areas by limiting the expansion of build-up land and by developing unutilized land in a limited way to increase the area of green space after reconciling economic conditions. Projection results promote the rational allocation of various land-use types in the future (semi) arid region, such as artificial forestation, unutilized land development and restriction of urban expansion, and also lay the foundation for the formulation of policies such as water allocation and ecological protection to facilitate the sustainable development of regional society, economy and ecology."
Virtuous cycles and research for a regenerative urban ecology: The case of urban wood systems in Baltimore,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/238f539a9e513acdd29c9350e66cf8877f4662eb,M. Grove; J. Carroll; Michael F. Galvin; Sarah J. Hines; L. Marshall; G. Wilson,"The field of urban ecology has progressed since the mid-1990s through four major phases: an ecology in, of, for, and with cities. This progression reflects an interest to address the complexity of urban systems with social-ecological approaches. Further, this progression signifies an interest to address societal issues by co-designing and co-producing research in collaboration with diverse stakeholders from government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), businesses, and community associations. What remains unaddressed in this progression is a research mission orientation. While there may be a range of goals for an ecology with cities, a focus on regenerative urban ecologies is crucial. Regenerative ecologies may be seen as an endpoint along a continuum from degenerative ecologies to sustainability to regenerative ecologies. Regenerative ecologies rely upon feedback loops, similar to coral reefs and climax forests. In urban systems, these feedbacks in social-ecological systems may be considered virtuous cycles that create reinforcing, positive benefits for people and nature over time. Virtuous cycles or feedbacks are often conceived as a singular, positive feedback loop. However, virtuous cycles may be most impactful, adaptive, and resilient when they contain multiple positive and negative feedbacks and synergies. Research has several important roles in advancing virtuous cycles and regenerative urban ecologies. In this paper, we use our urban wood systems project in Baltimore as both a case study and model to illustrate an approach and lessons learned for regenerative ecologies, virtuous cycles, and the role of research. We conclude with lessons learned and consider opportunities and constraints for virtuous cycles, research, and regenerative urban ecologies in Baltimore and to other urban systems."
Karl Gaspar’s Transformative Spirituality: Rediscovering Precolonial Philippine Spirituality and Its Challenges to Contemporary Filipino Pentecostal Spiritualities,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23a78e2e6430b40d51426633b8b4e7cc802612bf,H. Sadje,"Today, Philippine society is confronted by different types of social problems that require solidarity with the poor, marginalized groups, and nature. In this regard, what can Filipino theologians do to address these challenges?  Carlito “Karl” Gaspar, in thinking theologically, proposes to rediscover the precolonial Filipino spirituality to address the social issues.  For Gaspar, precolonial Filipino spirituality is a transformative-oriented spirituality and inherently Maka-Diyos, Maka-Tao, Makakalikasan (For God, People, Nature).  Gaspar argues that reclaiming the roots of our connection with precolonial spirituality could lead us towards developing solidarity with the poor, with marginalized groups, and with nature.  Analyzing Gaspar’s The Masses Are Messiah: Contemplating the Filipino Soul (2010) as resource dissipation, this paper is an invitation to explore precolonial Filipino spirituality as a source to transform power structures. The paper is divided into five parts: First, the paper gives a brief introduction to the life and work of Karl Gaspar. Second, the paper offers an overview of Gaspar’s book, The Masses Are Messiah. Third, the paper discusses Gaspar’s transformative spirituality. Lastly, the paper advances the precolonial Filipino spirituality as a potential source for a holistic model of Filipino spirituality, especially for Filipino Pentecostal spirituality. Therefore, Filipino Pentecostal spirituality becomes meaningful, useful, and relevant in the Philippine context.

"Verifying the Synthesized Effects of Intensive Urban Land Use on Quality of Life, Ecology, and Urban-Land-Use Scale in China",2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23af51b9752189a1219b8dcec67d644edaaa9e83,Bingqing Li; Zhanqi Wang; Ji Chai,"Intensive urban land use has been proposed as a method to promote sustainable development in the context of rapid urban sprawl. However, a consensus has not been reached on whether this approach is beneficial for ecology and compatible with suitable living conditions. Exploring this issue in China will help promote high-quality development. Extant research has mainly explored the effects of intensive urban land use on quality of life, ecology, and urban-land-use scale separately, while a synthesized analysis in this regard is lacking. In the light of this, we establish an analysis framework by which to verify the effects of intensive urban land use on the three aspects, using data from China spanning 2005–2019, subjected to structural equation modeling. The results show that intensive urban land use has varying degrees of positive effects on quality of life, ecology, and urban-land-use scale. It had no strong effect on the three items initially, while quality of life was significantly optimized by 2010, and ecology was markedly improved from 2015. However, there was a trend toward shrinking living space and sprawling urban areas. The corresponding suggestions are formulated for policy makers to improve intensive urban-land-use policy."
Hello (more-than-human) World. Prototyping an Internet of Things for water with the project wildthings.io,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23b5264b9437472432bae8a79170cbe64830285c,B. Bachler,"Departing from the concept of an Internet of Things as a means to give voice to non-human ‘things’, this thesis examines the development of experimental prototypes for grassroots, community-run digital networks and DIY electronic devices as artistic interventions, as an exploration of how design communities can learn from the more-than-human world when building networked media. Since its emergence in the early 1990s, the ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT)—which imagines a global network infrastructure, in which physical ‘things’ are connected to the Internet—has mainly developed around human, market- and technology- driven concerns, where ‘smart’ devices are employed to make daily lives easier. While the current vision of an IoT is largely dominated by human intentions, this design research reconsiders an IoT which amplifies the voices of non-human ‘things’, and proposes avenues to shift focus from a human-centred to a more-than-human-centred design paradigm.
With a focus on wai/water, this design research engaged with local stream ecologies in Pōneke/Wellington that have largely disappeared from the cityscape, having been piped underground due to urban development. Data collected during fieldwork combines a variety of knowledges through interviews, observations, and immersions, as well as audio and video field recordings and sensor data, such as GPS, humidity, conductivity, and temperature. This intersection of knowledges inspired and informed the creation of design artefacts to learn how the more-than-human world can inform and inspire the development of networked media.
Creative outputs were openly documented in an online repository and concluded in the network installation “Papawai Transmissions”, which imagined novel ways of understanding and (re-) connecting with disconnected streams, their communities, and their ecosystems in urban Aotearoa/New Zealand. The research narrative of this thesis is presented in a combination of written word and audio-visual materials to make audible the many voices recorded during the lab- and fieldwork.
The research revealed how methods of slowness, seamfulness and openness—despite standing in contrast with the domination of quick development cycles in industry—provide opportunities for unheard voices to contribute towards more sustainable ways of designing networks within a more-than-human context."
Features of Fulica atra nesting on reservoirs with significant recreational load in the city of Kharkiv,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23c747e8a6d36f9b6018c1333da5d062178f82e7,T. Yarmak,"One of the tasks of modern ecology is to study the formation and sustainability of ecosystems in urbanized areas. The study of species that have a wide ecological plasticity and successfully adapt to the conditions of the anthropogenic landscape is important for a qualitative assessment of the city's avifauna and the current state of the species population. Fulica atra L. is one of the types of wetlands that has adapted to life under conditions of significant anthropogenic pressure. The studies were conducted from March to October 2021. The features of the placement of coot nests in areas with significant anthropogenic pressure have been analyzed. The coordinates of the nests found are plotted on the map. It was investigated that in urban conditions the coot prefers closed reservoirs with a large amount of coastal vegetation, and nests on the river were found singly. Nests are usually built on the folds of last year's plants, but there were also atypical nesting sites. The distance between the nests on the lake was 77.37 ± 40.38 m. The average size of the nest (n = 8): D = 39 cm, d = 24 cm, h = 15.5 cm. The dates of the appearance of the first clutches on Lake Kvituchem and on the Kharkiv River are in the third decade of April, and the last ones on the lake are in the third decade of May, and on the river - in the first decade of July. The average clutch size on Lake Kvituchem in 2021 was 7.81 ± 1.66 eggs. The morphometric parameters of the eggs were determined, their average size was 53.65 ± 2.1 x 36.86 ± 1.7 mm, the average weight was 36.09 ± 3.13 g. The success of hatching chicks in reservoirs with a significant recreational load has been investigated. The first chicks will appear on May 10-13. The features of the behavior of the gloss in relation to a person along with the nest during the setting of eggs were investigated. It was noted that the gloss reacts rather calmly to the constant presence of people on the territory of the nesting territory, but, during the incubation of eggs, it rather aggressively protects its nest. The results presented in the article deserve further monitoring."
Landscape Design for Flood Adaptation from 20 Years of Constructed Ecologies in China,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23dced466f56cd2e38a6b3dba8e84ec1aeb610a2,E. Palazzo; Sisi Wang,"In highly urbanized floodplains, it is becoming widely accepted that a change is needed to move away from flood control towards flood adaptation paradigms. To address riverine and flash flooding in urban areas, urban and landscape designers have developed design solutions that are able to increase urban ecological resilience by allocating space to fluctuating water levels. With the purpose of operationalizing flood resilience, this study explores how constructed ecology principles are applied to the design of multifunctional landscapes to restore floodplain functions in urban areas and prevent downstream flooding. The study adopts a design-by-research approach to examine 30 case studies from the Sponge Cities initiative realized in China in the last twenty years and develops a toolbox of Flood Adaptation Types for stormwater management. The results are aimed at informing operations in the planning and design professions by proposing a schematic design framework for flood adaptation in different geographic conditions, scales, and climates. The study sets up the bases for a systematic assessment of flood adaptation responses also by facilitating communication between disciplines, designers, and non-experts. This will enable evidence-based decisions in landscape architecture and urban design, as well as fulfill pedagogic purposes in higher education and research."
Wildlife in the urban environment: from habituation to conflict,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23ea1c489851b8fa7a23fc965274b94a9a57a498,Shmuel Moran,"
As the human population undergoes a process of urbanization, this causes a fundamental change in human-wildlife relations. (1) The environmental change leads to conflicts between species of wildlife and humans. Some species have adapted to urban environments to the extent that allows them to survive and, in some species, even thrive. (2) The process of urbanization depends on the characteristics of the urban environment, mainly the supply of food and water, suitable places for growing and roosting, and a sense of security. (3) The relationships between humans and urban wildlife are very complex, and they lead to conflicts between humans and wildlife. Vague complaints from residents after encounters with wild animals often result in an ineffective response from local authorities. (4) To protect both city residents and wildlife, municipalities must take the following actions: (a) Municipalities and stakeholders should receive professional advice before taking action. (b) All stakeholders, including wildlife conservation organizations, municipalities, and city residents, must cooperate in reducing the environmental conditions that create conflicts with urban wildlife. (c) Municipalities and stakeholders must leverage valuable information from the wealth of literature on urban wildlife ecology and mammal and bird management to develop targeted programs."
Investigation of the Epidemiological Situation of Malta Fever in the Cities under Mashhad University of Medical Sciences during the years 2016 to 2022,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23eb101e4c4c9eb290b06a10f8225f716453385d,Ayub Shokoufamanesh; Salman Daneshi; Iman Sarbisheh; Golnaz Peyravi Estakhr; N. Niknam; Rasoul Raesi,"
 
 Management of Malta fever disease requires policy-making and accurate epidemiological statistics and information.
 
 
 
 The present study was conducted to determine the epidemiological status of Malta fever.
 
 
 
 This study is of the secondary data analysis type, which was conducted using the recorded data of patients with brucellosis in the health center of Mashhad City from 2016 to 2022. Data related to 12,714 cases of brucellosis were analyzed using R software and Chi-2, Pearson, and independent t-statistical tests.
 
 
 
 The average age of the patients was 33.18 ± 18.81 years. About 87% of disease cases were related to rural areas and 13% to urban areas. The average annual incidence of the disease was 287 cases per 100,000 population at risk of the disease. The highest incidence rate was in 2020, and the lowest incidence rate was in 2016. The most cases of disease were related to the first three months of the year, and the least cases were related to the last three months of the year. Most cases of the disease were related to housewives, cattle breeders, and farmers.
 
 
 
 The incidence of the disease increased from the beginning of the study to 2020 and decreased from 2020 to the end of the study. Health policymakers should integrate medicine, ecology, and education for the prevention and control of brucellosis. This holistic strategy recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts across sectors to address the multifaceted nature of the disease.

A molecular survey of spotted fever group rickettsiae in introduced raccoons (Procyon lotor),2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23ee9d197c3ea9b7291473d850bdc6ac86807f10,J. Hildebrand; A. Perec-Matysiak; M. Popiołek; D. Merta; Izabella Myśliwy; K. Buńkowska-Gawlik,"Background The raccoon Procyon lotor (Linnaeus, 1758) (Carnivora; Procyonidae) is one of the most important and most intensively studied invasive mammal species in Europe. Within the last 30 years the raccoon has spread at an increasing rate, resulting in the establishment of local populations in various regions of Europe. In these newly colonised areas, gaps in knowledge of the raccoon’s biology concern not only most aspects of its ecology in a broad sense, but also its pathogens and parasites. Most micropathogens recorded hitherto in the raccoons that have colonised Europe have documented epizootic and zoonotic potential. Thus, it is considered especially important to investigate the role played by the raccoon in the spread of pathogens through both animal-animal and animal-human pathways. Methods Tissue samples of raccoons from Poland and Germany were examined in this study. In total, 384 tissue samples from 220 raccoons (170 spleen samples, 82 liver biopsies, 132 ear biopsies) were examined using molecular methods. The presence of Rickettsia spp. DNA was screened through amplification of a fragment of the gltA gene. Samples that were PCR positive for gltA were tested for other rickettsial genes, ompB and a 17-kDa antigen. For taxonomic purposes, the obtained sequences were compared with corresponding sequences deposited in GenBank using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, and phylogenetic analyses were conducted using Bayesian inference implemented in MrBayes software. Results Rickettsia DNA was confirmed only in skin biopsies; no isolates from the spleen or liver were positive for Rickettsia DNA. With the exception of one sample from Germany, which was positive for Rickettsia helvetica DNA, all the samples positive for Rickettsia DNA derived from the Polish population of raccoons. DNA of Rickettsia spp. was detected in 25 samples, i.e. 11.4% of the tested raccoons, and R. helvetica was confirmed in 52% of the positive samples. Additionally, single cases of Rickettsia monacensis , Rickettsia raoultii , and Candidatus Rickettsia kotlanii-like were found, and in 32% of all the positive samples similarity was shown to different Rickettsia endosymbionts. Out of the samples that tested positive for gltA , amplicons of ompB and 17 kDa were successfully sequenced from 14 and three samples, respectively. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this study provides, for the first time, evidence of the occurrence of Rickettsia pathogens and endosymbionts in the European population of raccoons. Further, broader research on different species of wild vertebrates, and ticks, as potential vectors and hosts for tick-borne pathogens, in natural as well as in peri-urban environments, is therefore required.

Anthroposea: Planning future ecologies in Mumbai’s wetscapes,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/240e2df9f6d7e02826ca4e89fd2db84db74d1150,N. Anand,"In this article, I describe Mumbai’s sea as an “anthroposea” – a sea made with ongoing anthropogenic processes across landwaters – to draw attention to the ways in which it troubles both urban planning and the making of environmental futures. I focus on three moments in which Mumbai’s more-than-human life now emerges in the anthroposea. First, I describe the surprising proliferations of lobsters, gulls, and fishers in a sewage outfall. Second, I draw attention to the city’s flourishing flamingo population amidst industrial effluents in the city’s industrial zone. Finally, the article floats towards a popular city beach where citizen scientists at Marine Life of Mumbai show the ways in which the city’s phenomenal biodiversity is making homes in and with the city’s plastic waste. I argue that these ongoing and dynamic relations between urban waste and more-than-human life make unstable and tenuous the modernist distinctions of nature/culture on which environmental and urban projects depend. The anthroposea does not easily permit the making of near futures. Instead, by crossing spatial scales and epistemological boundaries, the anthroposea holds the city and its citizens in the muddy materialities of an ongoing present; a present in which the vitalities of waste are intransigent, permanent, and generate life in the city’s landwaters."
Methodological Approaches to Reducing the Negative Impact of Transport on the Megalopolis Ecology,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2415a226b2e6360b39f98e7e97edb1c20d878771,D. Zavyalov; N.

Impacts of bioplastics and microplastics on the ecology of green-infrastructure systems: An aquaponics approach,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2415b4f60958ec203c26a10eea7f944666da92d1,Christina Varghese; Ayah Ismail; Dana Hindi; Sarah Nasher; Víctor Carmona-Galindo,"Abstract Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a bioplastic touted as an environmentally friendly solution due to its water solubility and potential to reduce plastic waste compared to the traditional polyethylene terephthalate (PET). However, few studies have characterized how PVA may impact the developmental dynamics of model organisms and biochemical processes in the environment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of PVA and PET on the growth and development of an Allium cepa plant model system. We used a controlled experimental design to evaluate plant growth in aquaponic mesocosms with dissolved PVA and suspended microplastics. We hypothesized that, relative to control plants, PVA would have fewer negative impacts than PET in terms of plant development, water chemistry, bacterial richness, and plant cell density. In both PVA and PET treatments, we detected a restricted rate of number of roots, mean root length, and mean shoot length, as well as an increased rate of change in water chemistry toward a more basic and saline environment. The lowest bacterial richness was detected in PVA, while the lowest cell density in the bulb- and root-tissues was detected in PET. Our study shows that both PVA and PET pollution similarly impacted the dynamics of the living system. We discuss bioplastics in the framework of a short-term solution to curb physical plastic-pollution and the need for long-term study of their effects on both abiotic and biotic interactions within the environment. We further propose future studies characterize the broader sustainability implications to urban green infrastructure."

"Breaking Consensus, Transforming Metabolisms",2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2437b44f514ccb340fbf1f6edd056dbb3fc40487,Salvatore Paolo De Rosa,"
 This article discusses the politics of direct action against fossil fuels put forward by climate justice movements, focusing in particular on the tactic of the blockade. Drawing on the conceptual toolkit of urban political ecology, the argument moves from a critique of the consensual regime of climate change governance to highlight conflict and dissent as central forces for the transformation of the socioecological metabolisms structuring the capitalist urbanization of nature—of which fossil fuels constitute the lifeblood. This approach shifts the debate around climate change politics from an issue of technological transition to one of metabolic transformation. On this basis, the article proposes a characterization of direct action against fossil fuels as expressions of metabolic activism: instances of grassroots ecopolitical engagement that aim to break consensus by disrupting capitalist-driven metabolic relations while also experimenting with alternative values, knowledges, spaces, and sociomaterial relations. To ground these reflections, the article offers an account of the Swedish climate justice coalition Fossilgasfällan and its successful three-year campaign, culminating in a blockade to halt the expansion of the gas terminal of Gothenburg port."
Scientific Knowledge Map Study of Therapeutic Landscapes and Community Open Spaces: Visual Analysis with CiteSpace,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/243a46a071f4174bf3062c8e3d5138bf46e86b11,Yan Han; Yuehui Liang,"The pursuit of a healthy and comfortable living environment is a key developmental objective for human society. Therapeutic landscapes play a significant role in improving environmental conditions within these spaces. However, current research suggests that there is still much to be explored in this field, particularly in communal open spaces. Based on the Web of Science literature database and using the CiteSpace visualization tool, this study launched a literature review search on the existing research content on therapeutic landscapes in community spaces by means of publication volume analysis, spatial distribution, keyword analysis, co-citation clustering analysis, keyword timeline, and co-occurring word analysis. Based on the research results, the current status and direction of related research are outlined, and the research hotspots and future trends in this field are analyzed. Current research comprises multiple interdisciplinary branches, such as geography, public space, modern medicine, care, horticultural therapy, urban ecology, and more, with theoretical research, caregiving, spatial territories, and research methodology as the main research vectors. It is clear from this study that the current research on community therapeutic landscapes suffers from a lack of coordination between theoretical and practical development, and the related design practice activities are in a vulnerable stage of development. In terms of the population served, specialized research will be one of the directions of development, as there has been a gradual increase in the number of spatial research on the prevention and complementary treatment of various diseases for subdivided groups. At the same time, the research focus in this field has shifted from the physical health of users to their mental health, leading to a trend of public service development with the objective of social health."
Agroecology and food sovereignty: Struggles for justice and healthy food in urban peripheral territories,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/249a498e444138acefbae12abd19baf389378b3f,Juliano Luís Palm; Marcelo Firpo Porto; Marina Tarnowski Fasanello; Diogo Ferreira da Rocha; Juliana Souza; Ana Paula da Cruz Santos; Rita de Cassia Ferreira dos Santos,"ABSTRACT In this work, we highlight lessons learned from research carried out by the Nucleus Ecologies and Encounters of Knowledge for Emancipatory Health Promotion (NEEPES) in partnership with the Center of Integration in Serra da Misericórdia (CEM) and the Movement of Homeless People of Bahia (MSTB), in peripheral territories in Rio de Janeiro and Salvador. The research sought to support and systematize knowledge and emancipatory practices of health promotion carried out by these experiences, based on four transversal thematic axes: food, care, housing and environmental protection, in addition to communication. The article focused on collective reflections on the first thematic axis, involving strategies to promote agroecology and food sovereignty, with experiences of production, circulation, and access to healthy food. Based on these reflections, we aim to contribute to discussions regarding the idea of Sustainable and Healthy Territories (SHT), especially through the lessons learned from the systematization of territorial experiences based on the notion of Emancipatory Health Promotion, which points to important contributions from the dimensions of environmental and cognitive justice. The systematization of these experiences highlights a movement of re-existence of traditional and community knowledge, which points to possible paths for the construction of SHT in urban peripheries."
"Response of Chickpea (Cicer aeritinum L.) Genotype to Intra and Inter Row Spacing at Huletegna Choroko, Southern Ethiopia",2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/24c4943caed75b9d0d6d12113f06516583e70c21,Tatek Tamiru; W. Worku; Worku Mengesha; Getu Weya,"Chickpea has a major role in the daily diet of the rural community and urban population as a good source of energy, protein, minerals, vitamins, fiber and its straw is used for animal feed, and it also improves soil fertility by fixing the atmospheric nitrogen. Optimum plant density and appropriate genotypes for a given agro ecology influences plant size, yield components and ultimately the seed yield. Hence, a field experiment was carried out to determine the effect of intra and inter-row spacing on growth, yield and yield component of chickpea (Cicer aeritinum L.) Genotypes under rain fed condition in Huletegna Choroko, Southern Ethiopia in 2016 cropping season. A split-split plot design with three replications was used with two chickpea genotypes: Genotypes Habru and Mastewal were arranged in main plot and intra-row spacing of 5, 10 and 15 cm in sub-plot and inter-row spacing’s of 30, 40 and 50 cm in sub-sub plot. Days to flowering and hundred seed weight were significantly different between the two genotypes. Intra-row spacing had significantly affected physiological maturity, nodule dry weight plant-1, plant height, primary branch plant-1, pods plant-1, seeds pod-1, above ground biomass and seed yield. Inter row spacing also significantly affected days to flowering, days to physiological maturity, nodule number plant-1, nodule dry weight, plant height, primary branch, pod plant-1, seed number pod-1, above ground dry matter and seed yield. Mastewal genotype obtained the maximum (2.91 t ha-1) grain yield at the combination of 15 cm intra row and 30 cm inter row spacing while Habru genotype obtained (2.57 t ha-1) at the same intra and inter-row spacing. Finally it could be concluded that intra row spacing of 15 cm and inter row spacing of 30 cm were found to be the optimum for maximum grain yield of chickpea using genotype Mastewal and Habru at Halaba, Huletegna choroko."
What kind of urban brand ecology attracts talent best? Grey configuration analysis of 98 Chinese cities,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/24c98bf39dc4f4478b0f07463bf23fe03a422807,Zhaohu Dong; Peng Jiang; Zongli Dai; Rui Chi,"PurposeTalent is a key resource for urban development, and building and disseminating urban brands have an important impact on attracting talent. This paper explores what kind of urban brand ecology (UBE) can effectively enhance urban talent attraction (UTA). We explore this question using a novel grey quantitative configuration analysis (GQCA) model.Design/methodology/approachTo develop the GQCA model, grey clustering is combined with qualitative configuration analysis (QCA). We conducted comparative configuration analysis of UTA using fuzzy set QCA (fsQCA) and the proposed GQCA.FindingsWe find that the empirical results of fsQCA may contradict the facts, and that the proposed GQCA effectively solves this problem.Practical implicationsBased on the theory of UBE, we identify bottleneck factors for improving UTA at different stages. Seven configuration paths are described for cities to enhance UTA. Theoretically, this study expands the application boundaries of UBE.Originality/valueThe proposed GQCA effectively solves the problem of inconsistent analysis and facts caused by the use of a binary threshold by the fsQCA. In practical case studies, the GQCA significantly improves the reliability of configuration comparisons and the sensitivity of QCA to cases, demonstrating excellent research performance."

Undesired social groups and forms of life are elided with disgusting elements of the environment to justify their suppression or eradication. The science and the management of filth have been central to modernity and have profoundly shaped urban life. The rise of microbiology revealed the microbial origins of some diseases, empowering visions of the sanitary city in both the metropole and the colony. This drove substantial investments in sanitation, hygiene, and the removal of animals and agriculture. However, recent research on the human microbiome has demonstrated the salutary role of some microbes for human well-being. It highlights the value of forms of material previously categorized as filth and calls for a recalibration of modern, antibiotic hygiene practices and modes of architecture and urban planning. This new microbiology is driving a nascent, probiotic turn in urban theory that overlaps with a wider appreciation of the beneficial role of nature in the urban environment, and the development of more affirmative models of urban hospitality premised on living with social difference. This review and perspective examines these connected developments, explores their implications for urban political ecology, and outlines a new research agenda. It starts with a chronology of the shifting material and semiotic relationships with filth in science and society, before identifying six key research questions to guide an interrogation of this new chapter in the storied history of filth and the city."
The Spatiality of Buddhism in Shenzhen: Exploration Through Guattari’s Three Ecologies,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/251cce4fd34d3d32c0f3a10e46f9a8c535e91dc1,Kai Shmushko,"This article explores the spatiality of Buddhism in the metropolis Shenzhen through its revitalization process in the past decades alongside the rapid expansion of the city. The author explores Buddhist practice communities within an urban village (chengzhongcun 城中村) and the central Buddhist temple build in the same neighbourhood. The article aims to illuminate some of the particularities and tensions of urbanization, environment, and the revival of Buddhism in the PRC. Building on Felix Guatarri's thesis of the three ecologies, the author presents a descriptive account of the main active communities in the examined neighbourhood. Furthermore, the article argues that, in order to understand the workings of Buddhist configurations in contemporary urban China, we must look at the registers of the environment, social structure, and human subjectivity. The article suggests that these three ecologies are interconnected and make up the ecology of Shenzhen Buddhism."
"The effect of urbanization and temperature on thermal tolerance, foraging performance, and competition in cavity‐dwelling ants",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/252a8a9dd0797839aa1c10d58cfa5a163301a7da,Brooke A. Harris; Dale R. Stevens; Kaitlyn A. Mathis,"Abstract Human disturbance including rapid urbanization and increased temperatures can have profound effects on the ecology of local populations. Eusocial insects, such as ants, have adapted to stressors of increasing temperature and urbanization; however, these evolutionary responses are not consistent among populations across geographic space. Here we asked how urbanization and incubation temperature influence critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and various ecologically relevant behaviors in three ant species in urban and rural locations in Worcester, MA, USA. We did this by incubating colonies of three species of cavity dwelling ant (Aphaenogaster picea, Tapinoma sessile, and Temnothorax longispinosus) from 2 habitat types (Rural and Urban), for 60‐days at multiple temperatures. We found that incubation temperature, urbanization, and species of ant all significantly affected overall colony critical thermal maximum. We also found that recruitment time, colonization time, and defense response were significantly affected by incubation temperature and varied between species of ant, while recruitment and colonization time were additionally affected by urbanization. These variable changes in performance and competitive traits across species suggest that responses to urbanization and shifting temperatures are not universal across species. Changes in behavioral responses caused by urbanization may disrupt biodiversity, creating unusual competitive environments as a consequence of natural adaptations and cause both direct and indirect mechanisms for which human disturbance can lead to local species extinction."
The Improvement of Environment in Huaihe River Basin-a Perspective of Ecological Compensation,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25360c38a90cc74ee039eb0e49e54a6e64bc10be,Ya-Nan Cheng,"The article explores the approaches to improve the urban environment in Huaihe River basin from the perspective of the ecological compensation system. First, it expounds the origin of “ecological compensation” in ecology and economics and then discusses its legal connotations and reviews the courses of national ecological compensation legislation. Second, the article illustrates the necessity of ecological compensation legislation in Huaihe River basin from revealing the current status of its urban environment and the legislative process. Finally, the article proposes three interrelated macro approaches to improve urban environment in Huaihe River basin: decentralization of government administration, participation of public and private enterprises and involvement of social communities."
A Planning Framework for Urban Resilience toward Climate Adaptation and Mitigation: Potentials and Limits of “Eco-Districts”,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/253e86fd303b40298eac967d1d0e63fe87b40150,I. Poli; Chiara Ravagnan; Laura Ricci,"In order to contribute to the debate on climate-proof urban regeneration, the study illustrated in this paper pays attention to the references for eco-districts as possible integrated frameworks that include urbanism and ecology toward urban resilience linked to environmental, social and governance “commitments”. To this end, the research activity has given answer to a need for a contextualization of the urban phenomena and the state of the art on sustainable development and climate proof urban resilience, pointing out the French context as an emblematic scope of study through a literature review of European best practices of eco-district. In consistency with this research framework, the study has developed a case study analysis, focusing on the description and evaluation of four best practices of French EcoQuartiers. The methodology adopted has selected with an inductive method the mitigation and adaptation strategies developed in the implementation of the French emblematic eco-quartiers, combining the official sources of the projects with on-site visits and surveys in order to define an experimental proposal of a grid of methodological-operational references relating to eco-districts. Furthermore, the discussion points out the potentials and limits of the proposed framework, related on the one hand to the quality, innovation, integration, and dissemination of the design solutions, and on the other hand to the economic and social costs of the EcoQuartiers that find a synthesis in the concept of “greentrification”. Finally, the conclusion highlights the interest of the contribution of the French context in climate proof planning and points out research interest in the other national contexts toward a European framework for eco-districts."

Migrant Ecologies,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/256a4cc5e93f2bb60dc60f29bb51c9d06b55fbe8,Xiaojin Zhou,"Migrant Ecologies investigates the ways in which Zheng Xiaoqiong’s poetry exposes the entanglements of migrant ecologies embedded within local and global networks of capital and labor. The author contends that women migrant workers in particular, as portrayed in Zheng’s poems, are the visible manifestation of the interconnections between the so-called “factories of the world” and slum villages-in-the-city, between urban development and rural decline, and between the local environmental degradation and the global market. By adopting an ecological approach to Zheng’s poems about women migrant workers in China, the author explores what Donna Haraway calls “webbed ecologies” (49). The concept of “ecologies” serves to enhance not only the layered, complex interconnections underlying women migrant workers’ plight and environmental degradation in China, but also the emergence and transformation of migrant spaces, subjects, activism, and networks resulting in part from globalization."
Assessment of the Ecological Condition of Informal Settlements Using the Settlement Surface Ecological Index,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2571f3b31f250768d087f65cc761543bd5bcf328,N. Mudau; P. Mhangara,"To manage urban ecological ecosystems adequately, understanding the urban areas’ biophysical characteristics is required. This study developed a settlement surface ecological index (SSEI) using tree, soil, impervious surface and grass covers, land surface temperature (LST), and soil moisture derived from Satellite Pour L’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 7 and Landsat 8 satellite images. The assessment of the SSEI was conducted over twelve sites of 300 m by 300 m. The selected sites contained formal and informal settlements of varying building densities. The SSEI values ranged from −0.3 to 0.54. Seven assessed areas are in the worst ecological condition with an SSEI below zero. Only three settlement types had an SSEI index value of 0.2 and above, and two of these areas were informal settlements. The formal low-density settlement with higher tree coverage displayed the highest index value of 0.54, slightly higher than the medium-density informal settlement. Overall, there is no significant difference in the SSEI values between the surface ecological condition of formal and informal settlements. The results achieved in this study can be used to understand urban ecology better and develop urban greening strategies at a city or settlement level."
The Evolution of Ecological Space in an Urban Agglomeration Based on a Suitability Evaluation and Cellular Automata Simulation,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/257d66148336f983d1f8a44fa7eabbe98f66fc1f,Yipu Chen; Bohong Zheng; Runjiao Liu,"Changing and reconstructing the ecological space of urban agglomerations is inevitable for ecological conservation and a scientific problem that needs urgent attention from geography, ecology, and urban and rural planning. Using ArcGIS and other software for data processing, this study established a spatial attribute database, constructed a land use conversion matrix of the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan (CZX) urban agglomeration’s ecological space, and quantitatively analyzed the main changes in ecological land. Using a trained cellular automata model with predicted land use in 2035 as the threshold value, the simulation research was presented by creating two simulation scenarios for the spatial distribution of land use by 2035 in the “Green Heart” area of the CZX urban agglomeration. The simulation results were compared, and the constraining role of land use suitability evaluation on ecological space evolution was analyzed. This study found that the total area of ecological space in the Green Heart area saw a rapid reduction, and it predicted that, by 2035, the total area of the CZX Green Heart area will have decreased. Comparing the two simulation scenarios proved the hypothesis that zoning ecological space reconstruction based on a land suitability evaluation can effectively protect ecological space and ensure ecological network functions are harnessed."
Landscape-scale mapping of soil fungal distribution: proposing a new NGS-based approach,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25819fbeb539728e5100cc4a064ba955ee0129c8,Daniel Janowski; T. Leski,"Soil fungi play an indispensable role in the functioning of terrestrial habitats. Most landscape-scale studies of soil fungal diversity try to identify the fungal taxa present at a study site and define the relationships between their abundance and environmental factors. The specific spatial distribution of these fungi over the site, however, is not addressed. Our study’s main objective is to propose a novel approach to landscape-scale mapping of soil fungi distribution using next generation sequencing and geographic information system applications. Furthermore, to test the proposed approach and discuss its performance, we aimed to conduct a case study mapping the spatial distribution of soil fungi on the Wielka Żuława island. The case study was performed on the Wielka Żuława island in northern Poland, where soil samples were collected every 100 m in an even grid. The fungal taxa and their relative abundance in each sample were assessed using the Illumina platform. Using the data obtained for the sampled points, maps of soil fungi spatial distribution were generated using three common interpolators: inverted distance weighted (IDW), B-spline, and ordinary Kriging. The proposed approach succeeded in creating maps of fungal distribution on Wielka Żuława. The most abundant groups of soil fungi were Penicillium on the genus level, Aspergillaceae on the family level, and ectomycorrhizal fungi on the trophic group level. Ordinary Kriging proved to be the most accurate at predicting relative abundance values for the groups of fungi significantly spatially autocorrelated at the sampled scale. For the groups of fungi not displaying spatial autocorrelation at the sampled scale, IDW provided the most accurate predictions of their relative abundance. Although less accurate at predicting exact relative abundance values, B-spline performed best in delineating the spatial patterns of soil fungi distribution. The proposed approach to landscape-scale mapping of soil fungi distribution could provide new insights into the ecology of soil fungi and terrestrial ecosystems in general. Producing maps of predicted fungal distribution in landscape-scale soil fungi diversity studies would also facilitate the reusability and replicability of the results. Outside the area of research, mapping the distribution of soil fungi could prove helpful in areas such as agriculture and forestry, nature conservation, and urban planning."

Bernetti; V. Alampi Sottini; Lorenzo Bambi; Elena Barbierato; Tommaso Borghini; Irene Capecchi; Claudio Saragosa,"Cities are human ecosystems. Understanding human ecology is important for designing and planning the built environment. The ability to respond to changes and adapt actions in a positive way helps determine the health of cities. Recently, many studies have highlighted the great potential of photographic data shared on the Flickr platform for the analysis of environmental perceptions in landscape and urban planning. Other research works used panoramic images from the Google Street View (GSV) web service to extract urban quality data. Although other researches have used social media to characterize human habitat from an emotional point of view, there is still a lack of knowledge of the correlation between environmental and physical variables of the city and visual perception, especially at a scale suitable for urban planning and design. In ecology, the environmental suitability of a territory for a given biological community is studied through species distribution models (SDM). In this work we have adopted the state of the art of SDM (the ensemble approach) to develop a methodology transferable to cities with different sizes and characteristics that uses data deriving from many sources available on a global scale: social media platform, Google internet services, shared geographical information, remote sensing and geomorphological data. The result of our application in the city of Livorno offers important information on the most significant variables for the conservation, planning and design of urban public spaces at the project scale. However, further research developments will be needed to test the model in cities of different sizes and geographic locations, integrate the model with other social media, other databases and with traditional surveys and improve the quality of indicators that can be derived from information shared on the Internet."

The biodiversity of urban gardens is measured using species diversity indicators such as species richness, Simpson, Shan-Wiener, and Pielou evenness in this paper. The landscape single dynamic attitude, landscape comprehensive dynamic attitude and landscape patch transfer matrix were selected to construct a landscape dynamic change model, and the six urban areas of H city were used as the research object to analyze the landscape pattern of vegetation cover in urban gardens and landscapes. The results showed that among the area indexes on the landscape level in the study area of H city from 2018 to 2022, the maximum patch index, patch density and edge density indexes increased year by year, with an increase of 0.24, 3.42 m*hm−2, and 0.21 hm−2, respectively, in five years. Among the aggregation indexes, the effective particle size index showed an increasing trend, with an increase of 4301.3ha2 in 2022 compared with that in 2018, and the aggregation index showed a gradual decreasing trend, with a decrease of 0.4 in 2022 compared to 2018. By analyzing the landscape pattern, the changes in the landscape pattern can be described, and then the internal mechanism affecting the landscape pattern can be determined, which is of significant significance for the study of urban garden landscape planning and construction."

Cuadros; Yisela Quispe-Flores; Katherine Burgos-Andrade,"The Black-and-chestnut Eagle Spizaetus isidori is an endangered and little-known top predator of South American montane forests. To better understand the breeding ecology and threats of this eagle, we studied several pairs between 2017 and 2022 in the central Andes of Peru. We recorded 62 adults, one immature, and 36 juveniles in 36 territories. These territories were in mountainous areas (altitudinal range 690–3,810 m a.s.l.), widely covered by montane forests (43.8–99.7% cover), and secondarily by open land (0.3–56.2% cover), far from urban settlements (1.3–27.1 km). Nesting sites (N = 15) were at medium altitudes (1,330–2,330 m a.s.l.) in steep hillsides or ravines (15–55°), having no preferential cardinal orientation, and relatively close to permanent water courses (20–800 m), open areas (30–930 m) and sites with human activity (120–2,200 m). Nests (N = 15) were placed at the top of tall (28–40 m) and thick-stemmed (DBH range 0.53–1.52 m) emergent trees of nine genera, with Ficus and Juglans being the most used. Incubation and brood-rearing occurred during the dry season (Mar–Nov). The wooded slopes where the eagles nested are being replaced by crops and livestock pastures, causing an estimated loss of 218.2 km2 of forest cover in our study area (5,056 km2) during the last 20 years. We detected human persecution in 55.5% of the territories, resulting in 26 juveniles, four adults, two immatures, and nine unaged eagles killed. Preventing the local extinctions of these eagles will require long-term population monitoring, improving knowledge of its ecology, mitigation of human-eagle conflict, development of education programs, and strengthening of land use inspection."

 Privileging Water in Lima, Mexico City, and New Orleans: An Environmental History charts the development of the indigenous hydro-social territories and their colonial transformations into “modern” political ecologies. This book begins with a summary of the environmental histories of these regions before the arrival of people. To give water its due as an agent of historical processes, it is important to understand its role in shaping these three distinct ecosystems – a role it still plays today despite thousands of years of human intervention in the hydrological nature of those systems. It is certain that, as human-caused climate changes rework ecosystems worldwide, surviving the Anthropocene in Mexico City, New Orleans, and Lima will require other ways of knowing water – as hydro-social territories that challenge modern notions of urbanism and foreground ways of knowing formerly considered archaic. Following the inextricable histories of water and anthropogenic landscapes provokes many questions about the nature of cities, especially questions of environmental justice. The answers should not be abstract or universal. Instead, Clare Cardinal-Pett argues that urbanization on the planet must be reimagined and reconstructed as bio-regional systems and hydro-social territories that can be best defined more comprehensively as political ecologies."
Stakeholders’ perceptions of social and economic challenges in adopting sustainable urban development in post-war countries,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25b0b0504f3664f089f5bd8a3fac7a13c25a6273,Raed Fawzi Mohammed Ameen; H. Alyasari; Maryam D. Altaweel,"Due to rapid urbanization, developing countries have faced significant urban socio-economic challenges. The destruction and lack of planning are acute in countries, such as Iraq, that have suffered for several decades from wars and international sanctions, resulting in severe damage to the ecology sector, social utilities and the disruption of the economic sector. Many urban development projects are currently underway in Iraq, and labelled as a means to reform. However, most lack public participation. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand the public’s perception, especially of in urban areas with socio-economic challenges, and this represents a crucial concern for many planners, designers, and policy-makers seeking to develop effective policies. This study aims to investigate stakeholder perceptions of the urban challenges and their priorities in Iraqi cities. A nationwide survey was conducted (N = 643), using a 19-item structured questionnaire. PCA and statistical tests were applied to the collected responses, to investigate the relationships around such challenges. A high value of internal consistency and reliability was achieved (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.867) and five components were identified. The item ‘safety of public places’ was ranked as the most important. Results illustrate a link between deficiencies in the social and economic infrastructures."
Divine and wine: negotiating the past in Nashik’s urban future,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25c044deacad33c8671ad79b33aca7708297ee4f,S. Dahake,"ABSTRACT With its religiosity and aspirations of becoming a world-class city, Nashik is oscillating between its past and future. As a city of pilgrimage and vineyards, Nashik is experimenting by re-imaging itself to attract global capital. This article analyzes the politics of the urban utopias envisaging different futures for Nashik by examining the ambitious state-led Godavari Riverfront Development projects. Extending the idea of “worlding,” I analyze the state-sanctioned utopian imaginations and how they become sites that expose alternative futures. I take the Kumbh Mela (largest Hindu congregation) of 2015 as a critical event that makes multiple urban utopian imaginings immediately recognizable in Nashik. Further, using the political ecology framework, I unpack the contestations between these utopian visions and how locals embody state-sanctioned urban utopias, organize resistance, and pose alternative visions of Nashik’s future. By doing so, I argue, there is a need to investigate local peculiarities when assessing the dynamic worlding processes."
﻿The role of community science in orthopteran research,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25c4c598b82c627ebefe43c78ae1d90c13354e43,Amy R. Byerly; Thomas J. Firneno Jr.; Riley Beard; E. Larson,"Orthopterans are commonly encountered in rural, suburban, and urban landscapes and have charismatic songs that attract the public’s attention. These are ideal organisms for connecting the public with science and critical concepts in ecology and evolution, such as habitat conservation and climate change. In this review, we provide an overview of community science and review community science in orthopterans. Best practices for orthopteran community science are provided, with a focus on audio recordings and highlighting new ways in which scientists who study orthopterans can engage in community science.
 Before the modern era, scientific discovery was commonly made by people who were not scientists by profession (Brenna 2011, Miller-Rushing et al. 2012). This began to change in the middle of the nineteenth century when science became highly academic, with greater “gatekeeping” of knowledge, and data collection became increasingly expensive. As a result, much of the knowledge gained during that time has been effectively withheld from non-scientists in difficult-to-obtain scientific journals, and there were few opportunities for the public to directly engage with scientific research. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort from the scientific community to change the way we engage with the public. These “citizen” or “community” science projects are filling gaps in the modern approach to scientific inquiry (Jordan et al. 2012, Toomey and Domroese 2013, Johnson et al. 2014). Here, we provide an overview of community science and highlight the exciting and unique role that community science can play in orthopteran research. We focus on how acoustic surveys can be used to study orthopteran biodiversity, provide best practices for orthopteran community science, and suggest future avenues for research."

The Influence of Habitat on Viral Diversity in Neotropical Rodent Hosts,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25c67da95991ba2bd2642ffa5968350dd5deed03,Sourakhata Tirera; B. de Thoisy; D. Donato; C. Bouchier; V. Lacoste; A. Franc; A. Lavergne,"Rodents are important reservoirs of numerous viruses, some of which have significant impacts on public health. Ecosystem disturbances and decreased host species richness have been associated with the emergence of zoonotic diseases. In this study, we aimed at (a) characterizing the viral diversity in seven neotropical rodent species living in four types of habitats and (b) exploring how the extent of environmental disturbance influences this diversity. Through a metagenomic approach, we identified 77,767 viral sequences from spleen, kidney, and serum samples. These viral sequences were attributed to 27 viral families known to infect vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and amoeba. Viral diversities were greater in pristine habitats compared with disturbed ones, and lowest in peri-urban areas. High viral richness was observed in savannah areas. Differences in these diversities were explained by rare viruses that were generally more frequent in pristine forest and savannah habitats. Moreover, changes in the ecology and behavior of rodent hosts, in a given habitat, such as modifications to the diet in disturbed vs. pristine forests, are major determinants of viral composition. Lastly, the phylogenetic relationships of four vertebrate-related viral families (Polyomaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, and Phenuiviridae) highlighted the wide diversity of these viral families, and in some cases, a potential risk of transmission to humans. All these findings provide significant insights into the diversity of rodent viruses in Amazonia, and emphasize that habitats and the host’s dietary ecology may drive viral diversity. Linking viral richness and abundance to the ecology of their hosts and their responses to habitat disturbance could be the starting point for a better understanding of viral emergence and for future management of ecosystems."

Rimoldi Pablo; Marianela Scuderi,"This study investigates the trophic ecology and behavioral patterns of Athene cunicularia in Funes, Santa Fe, Argentina, during 2023-2024. Observations were made of two individuals throughout the four seasons of the year, recording a total of 16 hours of behavior. The results revealed that the owl showed a varied diet composed of 946 prey items identified in 134 pellets, with arthropods as the main source (91.89%). The pellets presented an average size of 31.98 mm and a weight of 1.31 g. Seven behavioral patterns were identified, with rest being the most frequent, especially in autumn and winter. Variations in diet and behavior appear to reflect adaptations to environmental conditions and resource availability, suggesting that the species is opportunistic and generalist. These findings contribute to the understanding of the ecology of A. cunicularia in urban environments, highlighting its role in the local ecological balance."

Towards an Indigenous-Informed Multispecies Collaboratory,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26216dedd5c6defec04d2bebabb09da74f0fe661,S. Wooltorton; P. White,"
 How does Australia’s latest Indigenous defeat relate to Environmental Education? The answer is direct complicity. This paper begins with the premise that the failure of Australia’s 2023 referendum on “The Voice to Parliament” is directly connected with education. The chapter builds on the proposition that local and Indigenous public knowledge could — and should — be the heart of environmental education. We apply a post-qualitative practice that is underpinned by innovative feminisms and the post-qualitative methods within a Multispecies Collaboratory, an experimental way of transforming our learning by attending to the responsive, relational world of all beings. We use this practice to think with while exploring socio-ecological relations, especially our own. Collaboratory colleagues include rivers with their kincentric ecologies, urban park ecosystems and backyard kin or families. Journaling, creative writing and photography record our learning journeys. The article concludes that continuing colonisation, epistemic violence and a culture of denial reinforce the dominant paradigm of silencing Indigenous voices. We argue that an Indigenous-informed onto-epistemology of living place can — and should — inform the heart and practice of environmental education, and an Indigenous-informed Multispecies Collaboratory is one way to deepen the multispecies engagement that underpins environmental education."
"The Evolution of Green Development, Spatial Differentiation Pattern and Its Influencing Factors in Characteristic Chinese Towns",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26227db4bbd2d00b39719989b5523ca9a5c385e1,Xiaowei Zhang; Xinjian Huang; Jiujun Li,"Characteristic Chinese towns are “green ecology” innovation space units based on the background of the ‘Beautiful China Initiative’ (BCI), new urbanization, supply-side structural reform and the implementation of rural revitalization strategies. In this paper, spatial analysis models such as kernel density analysis, spatial autocorrelation analysis, the local correlation index and ArcGIS 10.5 are used to analyze the spatial layout and structural characteristics of the green development evolution of characteristic towns and to explore their spatial differentiation characteristics and laws, internal influencing factors and mechanisms. The analysis of the spatial distribution kernel density shows that regional economic development is an important influencing factor that affects the layout of the characteristic towns. Spatial autocorrelation analysis indicates that the spatial distribution of the characteristic towns does not have random distribution characteristics but is clustered in areas of similar scale. The results show the following: (1) The spatial layout of characteristic towns is generally a cohesive distribution with obvious agglomeration trends and differences, showing the characteristics of “dense in the southeast, sparse in the northwest” and “overall agglomeration, relying on economy, along the coast and along traffic arteries, spreading around cities, and differentiating by scenery”. (2) The high-density core area and sub-high-density area of characteristic towns are situated along the coast and along traffic arteries, are characterized by resource endowments and economic development, and are distributed along urban agglomerations and metropolitan areas. (3) The spatial pattern of green development evolution is organically coupled across three dimensions: location, industry and community. Our research results will help improve the level of green development in characteristic towns; coordinate the spatial layout of new urbanization; improve regional, high-quality, and coordinated development; and realize Chinese-style modernization for common prosperity."
"Searching for food in a concrete jungle: feeding ecology of a Psittacine assemblage (Aves, Psittacidae) in a major Amazonian city.",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/262b92f27e7c1ef8cc8b12b2a1d3d7225400e2eb,C. S. Soares; A. Barnett; V. V. Scudeller; S. H. Borges,"The efficient use of food resources is a precondition for wild species´ survival in urban environments. The feeding ecology of animals in tropical cities, however, remains poorly investigated. Here we study the feeding ecology of parrots in Manaus, a major Amazonian city, and compare the results with a parrot assemblage living in undisturbed habitats. We recorded 203 feeding bouts from eight parrot species, which consumed parts of 51 plant species. Parrot diets were dominated by native palm species (Arecaceae). Exotic plants, however, constituted an important portion of the diet of some parrots. Levin's indices, a measure of food niche width, varied from 0.40 to 0.83, indicating an overall tendency to generalist diets. Diet overlap between species was small, indicating broad resource partitioning between members of the assemblage. The diversity of plants consumed in the natural environment was greater than in the urban environment (71 species vs. 52). However, the diversity of plants consumed was similar for parrot species recorded both in natural and urban environments, indicating that occupation of the city does not imply an impoverishment in parrot diets. Creation of municipal protected areas and increasing the city afforestation would provide complementary strategies for Manaus parrot conservation."
Contact Strategies: Histories of Native Autonomy in Brazil by Heather F.

The final chapter focuses on the continuity of Nahuatl document production in Xochimilco and its eventually decline in tandem with the political, economic, and climate disruptions of the late eighteenth century Islands in the Lake is a valuable contribution to the history and ethnohistory of central Mexico that adds an important local perspective to patterns and processes that historians have documented at a regional scale. It benefits from Conway’s inclusion of recent insights from the findings of environmental history, climate science, and disease ecology, and it invites readers from disciplines other than history to pay attention. Archaeologists should see an opportunity to work more closely with historians of Indigenous Mexico. Although Conway uses archaeological sources to establish the Prehispanic roots of Xochimilco (mostly in the first half of the first chapter), future works should consult a rich and growing archaeological and bioarchaeological literature about the urban and rural communities of the sixteenthto eighteenth-century Basin of Mexico. Critical historians will notice the nature of archival production in Xochimilco. For example, gender plays a prominent role in Chapters 2 through 4, in which Conway makes important points about how Indigenous women protected land through wills and testaments, brought revenue into the community as sellers in markets throughout the region, and used marriage alliances to maintain continuity of local leadership. Gendered, and maybe other, disparities of record keeping, are worth investigating (perhaps in conversations with historical archaeologists). Historical ecologists and political ecologists will find Conway’s environmental-history approach a welcome addition to their studies of the recursive relationships of humans and their environments in the Basin of Mexico and beyond."
MODERN METHODS OF URBAN ENVIRONMENT LAND USE MONITORING,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2644f49466197840c270cd1842b95bad0c667b7e,M. Pilicheva; O. Kondrashchenko; E. Shterndok,"In the context of urbanization and global climate change, the need to adapt and respond to land use dynamics is becoming increasingly important. Cities are constantly transforming, and this transformation affects the social, economic and environmental aspects of the lives of their inhabitants. Accordingly, monitoring tools and methods must be flexible, adaptive and capable of working in real time. Thanks to the latest technologies and monitoring methods, it became possible to quickly analyse changes and predict the future of urban development. In this aspect, remote sensing of the Earth should be noted. The advantages of this tool include: large territorial coverage; high frequency of pictures; the possibility of analysis in different spectral ranges, etc. Geoinformation systems are an equally important tool. GIS allows you to combine, analyse and visualize spatial data. 3D modelling can also be noted as an important tool. With the help of modern technologies, such as laser scanning, it has become possible to create detailed three-dimensional models of urban areas. Separately, automated systems for controlling the use of the territory of cities should be singled out. Due to the proliferation of digital technologies, citizens can actively participate in monitoring processes using mobile applications, public observation platforms and other tools for data collection and sharing. In the monitoring processes of urban land use, mathematical modelling plays a key role in predicting urban land use. The models help researchers and authorities understand current trends and make predictions about the future development of urban areas. Several mathematical modelling approaches can be distinguished, which include: city growth models, geostatistical models, agent-based models, regression models, system dynamic models, optimization models, landscape ecology, diffusion models, socio-economic models, scenario analysis models , combined models. Several different modelling methods are often combined to obtain the most complete and accurate picture.

"Volunteer Urban Environmental Stewardship, Emotional Economies of Care, and Productive Power in Philadelphia",2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/264a260f4ed12b77648fdc3b543e8656aab5aff4,Alec Foster,"Recent efforts to increase urban forests and greenspaces rely on the volunteer labor of individuals and environmental nonprofits. The estimation of market values has often justified urban greening. These neoliberal approaches to urban environmental governance have been heavily critiqued, revealing the uneven power relationships and urban environments that result. This paper aims to move beyond such critiques by exploring how the reproduction of urban nature can be valued outside of the market. Fieldwork with volunteers participating in environmental stewardship in Philadelphia revealed their participation was motivated by intense emotional attachments to their neighborhoods, other participants, and nonhuman others, leading me to propose emotional economies of care as an alternative framework. The circulation of emotions and affects between participants, places, and nonhuman others forms an emotional economy. The generative power of this circulation makes emotional economies of care collective bodies or multiplicities. Furthermore, these multiplicities produce power from below, in counterpoint to the top down power of neoliberal environmentalities. However, just as these multiplicities come together, they can come apart or change directions. I close with ideas on how emotional ecologies and economies of care can be brought into being and processes of change within them shepherded in progressive ways."
"Vulnerable spaces, unequal responses: lessons for transformative climate resilience in Lagos",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2656977b85f22ea9376cb0a0fa76cb13ec89c6a4,Susan S. Ekoh; Lemir Teron,"Urban coastal megacities like Lagos face flooding challenges that may be exacerbated by climate change in the future. Through an urban political ecology lens, this study engages with the dynamics of politics and power that produce differentiated flood impacts and adaptation strategies. Data from telephone interviews of 21 Lagos residents across the mainland and island areas reveal people's understanding of their flood vulnerabilities within the wider socio-political context of Lagos. In particular, state failure in the provisioning of services, amenities, and overall flood protection, shapes flood risk in Lagos. In addition, income and access to material resources inform people's experiences and ability to cope with flooding. Furthermore, citizens apply localized strategies to prepare for and cope with flooding events, particularly through Community Development Associations (CDAs). These localized strategies have implications for transformative resilience. However, these forms of endogenous resilience cannot replace attention to wider urban governance challenges in cities like Lagos."
Advancing arboriculture through human and tree ecology,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2662becd219591de43bc4c555e5ba64d26ffe8db,Kevin Frediani,"Abstract This paper explores the significance of ecosystem functions in maintaining the health and balance of ecological systems, particularly in the context of planning, managing, and maintaining trees in landscape settings. It emphasises the multifaceted relationship between humans and trees, encompassing cultural, ecological, economic, and emotional connections, and underscores the value of traditional ecological knowledge alongside empirical science. By combining these two ways of knowing, along with social science insights into human health and well-being, future landscapes can be crafted to be sustainable, diverse, and functional. As urbanisation continues to shape landscapes globally, urban planners face the challenge of managing rapidly changing environments. Urban forestry and arboriculture have emerged to address these challenges, aiming to enhance environmental quality and human well-being. The concept of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) has gained traction, recognising the importance of integrating natural systems into urban planning to address environmental challenges while preserving functional ecosystems. This paper advocates for an enhanced understanding of tree and human ecology to navigate the complex relations between trees, people, and their environments. It calls for interdisciplinary collaboration, research, and education to inform policy, assess environmental impacts, and widen approaches to ecosystem management. By monitoring ecosystem health and collaborating across disciplines, arboriculturists and urban foresters can shape resilient practices for tree conservation and sustainable urban development. In conclusion, integrating tree ecology into urban planning and management practices is essential for ensuring the health, resilience, and sustainability of tree populations and the ecosystems they inhabit. By embracing a holistic understanding of trees and their environments, professionals can contribute to shaping future landscapes that support both human well-being and biodiversity."
"Speculating on land, property and peri/urban futures: A conjunctural approach to intra-metropolitan comparison",2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/267731305ff3b9d4a19f445e26f7c97a0167db9f,H. Leitner; E. Sheppard,"This article explores a conjunctural approach to comparison as a means to capture the complexity of the processes shaping metropolitan land transformations in a city of the global South, comparing the co-implicated actions of developers and local residents across central and peri-urban Jabodetabek. A conjunctural approach shares with some other forms of comparison the ambition to build new theories and challenge existing knowledge. Rather than controlling for the characteristics of units of analysis as in conventional comparison, a conjunctural approach attends to the broader spatio-temporal conjuncture. It involves highlighting unexpected or overlooked starting points for comparison, attending to inter-place, inter-scalar and inter-temporal relationalities in order to identify shared general tendencies as well as particularities and to chart their mutual constitution. Grounding this comparison iteratively puts local knowledge and observations in conversation with already existing theories. Deploying these principles in a socio-spatial intra-metropolitan comparison, we show that economic speculation on land and property is complexly entangled with actors’ socio-cultural speculations, as they seek also to realise aspirations for distinct peri/urban futures. Economic speculation deepens already existing inequalities in wealth and power differentials between and among developers and kampung residents. The erasure of informal settlements and displacement of their residents is supplemented by the ability of other kampungs and select residents to take advantage of spillover opportunities from the formal developments built on former kampung land. Distinct central city and peri-urban landscapes are emerging, shaped by differences in the social ecology of land and local governance and planning regimes."
"Assessment of public open space research hotspots, vitalities, and outlook using CiteSpace",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/269038e17c70a5552b0abb8552fdd3f14a17187a,Kexin Ren; Xianhua Sun; Jeremy Cenci; Jiazhen Zhang,"ABSTRACT Urbanization is essential for human development and progress. Therefore, it is urgent to study urban public open space (POS) under the dual impact of urbanization construction and the global COVID-19 outbreak. Bibliometric visual analysis is currently popular in academia, as it can be used to analyze specific fields. This research summarizes the development history, hotspots, and trends in POS, with theoretical and data support based on the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection. The study period was from 2002 to 2022. A total of 398 papers were collected, with the number of papers increasing over time. The research covers various fields, including environment, architecture, ecology, geography, design, behavior, etc. The results show that POS research hotspots include form layout, social value, and sustainable renewal. This paper demonstrates that there is a lack of vitality in urban POS. Although affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the fundamental reason for this is that the vitality of POS is not created from multiple dimensions. Vitality should be enhanced according to the space’s terrain, ecology, environment, and other factors. POS research lacks crossdisciplinary collaboration and the fusion of multiple fields. Thus, cooperation between the various disciplines involved must be strengthened. In the future, POS research should change its design concept, continue to place the “human” in the leading position, establish a multidisciplinary research system, use local empirical cases, and develop applicable theories that can be extended upon. Thus, it will be possible to build harmonious open spaces that enhance the relationship between the people and the land and provide practical solutions for other countries in which urbanization is advancing."
An Analysis of Current Sustainability of Mexican Cities and Their Exposure to Climate Change,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/269f8f9b02b623d72666693ff379e8f2a0681ba4,F. Estrada; J. Velasco; A. Martínez-Arroyo; Óscar Calderón-Bustamante,"The increasing demand for goods and services in cities around the world due to a rapidly growing urban population is pushing the socioecological systems that support them to their limits. The complexity of urban socioeconomic and environmental systems and their interactions generate a challenging multidimensional decision problem. In response, governments around the world are currently generating a variety of measurements that aim to portrait the main factors that are related to the level of sustainability that a city shows. While the objective of these efforts is to help in the process of urban policy making, these measures are often hard to interpret and do not lend to discover underlying characteristics that may be common among a group of cities. Moreover, these measures are typically focused on describing the current state and omit future challenges such as climate change, which may significantly affect any evaluation of urban sustainability. Recently, the Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC) of Mexico produced a dataset of 36 sustainability related variables for over 100 cities that has the objective of helping federal and state level governments defining sustainable urban strategies. Here we use multivariate statistical techniques to (1) decrease the dimensionality of the dataset and find indices that could be more useful to decision makers; (2) find commonalities among cities include in the dataset in order to help in designing urban strategies for cities with similar characteristics; (3) cities are ranked in terms of their sustainability and characteristics and; (4) the sustainability ranking is compared to estimates of how much the current climate in each of these cities is expected to change during this century, which would add further challenges to maintain or improve urban sustainability."

Diversity and distribution of larval habitats of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in northern Spain: from urban to natural areas,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26a9af8b334bf55ed189900aa219ace90e6ec09b,M. González; A. Cevidanes; F. Goiri; J. Barandika; A. García-Pérez,"ABSTRACT: Studies of the biodiversity of mosquito larval habitats are important for vector-borne disease control programs and help to improve vector distribution maps. This study was designed to investigate the geographical distribution of mosquito species and their larval habitats in urban, rural, and natural areas in northern Spain. Pre-imaginal stages were collected over two sampling periods (spring and summer) in 2019. In the laboratory, immature specimens were reared to the adult stage for species identification by morphological taxonomy and/or molecular methods. In total, 2,182 specimens belonging to 13 different native mosquito species of five genera were collected from 135 sampling points of which 59.2% harbored larvae. Culex pipiens s.l. was the most abundant species (45.1%), followed by Culex torrentium (12.3%), Anopheles maculipennis s.l. (10.2%), Culex hortensis (9.5%), and nine other species with lower frequencies that accounted for less than 25%. By molecular identification, An. maculipennis s.s. was identified as the only species within the An. maculipennis species complex and Cx. pipiens pipiens as the predominant subspecies of the Cx. pipiens species complex. Margins in large sunlit water bodies were the most suitable sites for An. maculipennis s.l., whereas Cx. pipiens s.l. was present in both natural and artificial habitats. The larval site index, species richness, and relative abundance of the mosquitoes were determined based on the characteristics of the sites where they were collected. The public health importance and ecology of some identified mosquitoes is also discussed."

Shaping Baltimore’s urban forests: past insights for present-day ecology,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26cab753416dfc07d63ced20d7b6a73655ecec46,N. Sonti; Matthew Baker; John J. Lagrosa; Michael Allman; J. M. Grove; Michelle P. Katoski,"
 
 Land use history of urban forests impacts present-day soil structure, vegetation, and ecosystem function, yet is rarely documented in a way accessible to planners and land managers.
 
 
 To (1) summarize historical land cover of present-day forest patches in Baltimore, MD, USA across land ownership categories and (2) determine whether social-ecological characteristics vary by historical land cover trajectory.
 
 
 Using land cover classification derived from 1927 and 1953 aerial imagery, we summarized present-day forest cover by three land cover sequence classes: (1) Persistent forest that has remained forested since 1927, (2) Successional forest previously cleared for non-forest vegetation (including agriculture) that has since reforested, or (3) Converted forest that has regrown on previously developed areas. We then assessed present-day ownership and average canopy height of forest patches by land cover sequence class.
 
 
 More than half of Baltimore City’s forest has persisted since at least 1927, 72% since 1953. About 30% has succeeded from non-forest vegetation during the past century, while 15% has reverted from previous development. A large proportion of forest converted from previous development is currently privately owned, whereas persistent and successional forest are more likely municipally-owned. Successional forest occurred on larger average parcels with the fewest number of distinct property owners per patch. Average tree canopy height was significantly greater in patches of persistent forest (mean = 18.1 m) compared to canopy height in successional and converted forest patches (16.6 m and 16.9 m, respectively).
 
 
 Historical context is often absent from urban landscape ecology but provides information that can inform management approaches and conservation priorities with limited resources for sustaining urban natural resources. Using historical landscape analysis, urban forest patches could be further prioritized for protection by their age class and associated ecosystem characteristics.

Lost items and exposed shame – dreamcore’s inheritance and transcendence of liminal space and defamiliarization,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26d42273f3b6fb829ad64df50c36888911776d4d,Haoxing Wu,"ABSTRACT Dreamcore originates from a video (or image) form submitted on 21 April 2018, when an anonymous user posted a thread on 4chan’s paranormal section collecting images that would make people feel ‘uncomfortable', and another user’s comment under it gained the attention of the community. And it has been a new subculture that uses familiar scenes to make the audience nostalgic but uneasy, with two important characteristics: ‘Lost items’ and ‘exposed shame’. In contrast to the philosophical concept ‘sense of material’, the absolutely independent defamiliarization, or liminal space’s ‘neither … nor … ’, ‘lost items’ pursues the familiarity in strangeness without resorting to the expression of magical reality, or using ambiguity between the two to create a ‘either … or …’ atmosphere; Compared with modern urban planning based on the principle of ‘ecology’, ‘exposed shame’ reveals infrastructures that do not match the natural setting in the image, causing abruptness and embarrassment. Both point to the dreamcore’s playful ambiguity, thus not being governed by serious art and symbolising the original intention of free creation."

Moinudheen; Arockianathan Samson; Sadhiq Ali,"This research delves into the ecology and behavior of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) within the bustling urban environment of the ATC market in Ooty, India. Through a comprehensive study conducted between August 20 and October 3, 2023, various aspects of sparrow dynamics were explored, including population demographics, feeding patterns, nesting preferences, and human interactions . The study area, a 150-year-old market nestled in the Western Ghats, serves as a critical habitat for the sparrows, attracting thousands of visitors daily during peak seasons . Population analysis revealed intriguing trends, with male sparrows exhibiting wider population ranges and variability compared to females . Furthermore, female sparrows displayed consistent feeding patterns throughout the day, with slightly higher counts observed in the evening . Sparrows were observed consuming unconventional food items like beef, chicken, and pork alongside traditional sources such as grains and vegetables, highlighting their adaptability to urban environments and diets . Nesting behavior analysis underscored sparrows’ preference for artificial structures, emphasizing the importance of providing suitable nesting habitats amidst urban development . However, a questionnaire survey revealed a concerning decline in sparrow awareness and conservation efforts among market visitors, necessitating urgent educational initiatives. The impending demolition of the ATC market poses a significant threat to the local sparrow population, emphasizing the need for immediate action to mitigate habitat loss and raise awareness for long-term conservation . Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the intricate relationship between sparrows and urban environments, underscoring the importance of proactive conservation measures to ensure the survival of these resilient bird species."

Yet urban natures are also becoming increasingly digitalized, whether through processes of monitoring, automation, mitigation, or augmentation. This text considers what “splintering urbanisms” materialize through programming nature as infrastructure. By focusing specifically on smart urban forests, I suggest that the management logics of smart infrastructures attempt to program and transform vegetation and its ecologies into uniquely efficient and responsive urban organisms. In the process, these programs of efficiency have the potential to exacerbate extractive economies and social inequalities that amplify and materialize through the “Internet of nature.”"
Evolution and prediction of rural ecological environment quality in eastern coastal area of China,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2712d0579d3366d8c884f7302cc647266428d6a4,Chao Ying; Yifan Li; Yuxin Chen; Jie Zhong; Shunyi Ai; Peng Tian; Qiyu Huang; Luodan Cao; Abdul M. Mouazen,"Introduction: Rural ecological environment construction, as a pivotal component of the rural revitalization strategy and ecological civilization construction strategy, plays an indispensable role in promoting sustainable agricultural development and safeguarding ecological security. An accurate assessment and prediction of Rural Ecological Environment Quality (REEQ) serves as the theoretical basis to achieving these goals, and provide scientific guidance for future rural ecological environment construction and planning. The field of regional ecology, proposed in the mid-20th century, represents an emerging interdisciplinary domain that integrates ecology, geography, and economics. It plays a pivotal role in addressing large-scale ecological challenges and fostering social sustainability. As global urbanization continues to advance, urban ecological environments undergo significant transformations under the pressures of intense human activities. Scholars have increasingly focused on the essence, evolutionary patterns, and causal mechanisms shaping urban ecological environment quality. Consequently, ecological environment assessments have evolved from singular pollution evaluations to comprehensive ecological appraisals. However, coastal rural area with complex geographical conditions and fragile ecological environments are often neglected and marginalized. Currently, there are few specialized evaluation systems for REEQ, making it difficult to accurately reveal the evolution pattern of rural ecological environment. This weakens its guidance on practical rural ecological environment governance and restoration.Methods: The Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model can simplify the identification process of driving factors for REEQ, reflect the feedback mechanism between indicators, and is conducive to scientific and accurate evaluation of REEQ. Therefore, we constructed an evaluation index system for REEQ based on the PSR. We measured REEQ in the eastern coastal area of China, analyzed its spatiotemporal characteristics and development trends, and used the obstacle degree model to identify obstacle factors. It is beneficial for rural areas to grasp the evolution laws of REEQ, provide theoretical basis for the formulation of sustainable development policies, and provide scientific policy recommendations.Results: Our findings indicate that: 1) From 2000 to 2020, REEQ in the eastern coastal area of China has continuously improved, with the index value increasing from 0.454 to 0.525, a total growth of 15.64%. The number of high-level REEQ areas increased from 0 to 29, showing a positive development trend. 2) High-density areas of REEQ in the eastern coastal area of China are concentrated in the northern parts of Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces. The center of REEQ has shifted from the southwest to the northeast. 3) The obstacle degrees of various criteria layers in REEQ are relatively stable, with the response subsystem being the highest, followed by the state and pressure subsystems. Forest coverage, per capita grain production, effective irrigation rate of farmland, afforestation area in the current year, per capita disposable income of rural residents, and per capita mechanical power of farmers are the main obstacle indicators. 4) From 2020 to 2035, REEQ in the eastern coastal area of China will continue to improve. The standard deviation ellipse will move towards the northwest, the center will shift from the southwest to the northeast, the rotation angle will slowly decrease, showing a northwestward trend."
The Techno-politics of Rental Housing Financialization: Real Estate Service Companies and Technocratic Expertise in Australia’s Build to Rent Market,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/271776a6d8b7852e78ed40afe290ac5943dcf62a,M. Nethercote,"Abstract This article argues private expertise is a driving force behind the global expansion of rental housing financialization and, particularly, the making of build to rent (BTR) assets and markets. It develops this argument by investigating Australia’s underexamined BTR market and global real estate service companies (RESCs) as ubiquitous yet unscrutinized intermediaries in this new financialization frontier. Its analysis heeds calls to attend to assetization, as the process of turning things into assets, deploying science and technology studies-inspired marketization approaches, which understand markets as sociotechnical assemblages, and their prior integration with critical political economy of financialization. This approach is enhanced by engaging with the techno-politics of market-making scholarship, which sensitizes assetization approaches to the politics of expertise. This conceptual move respecifies market devices (i.e., material and discursive assemblages of market making) as knowledge contingent (i.e., that require and assert expert knowledge) and provides conceptual terrain to explore the rule of private experts in assetization. Analysis of interviews, media, and industry reporting reveals how RESCs’ epistemic, discursive, and technical efforts format the emergent market, making BTR assets thinkable, visible, calculable, and transactable. This article repositions rental housing financialization as a techno-political project led in nontrivial ways by private experts who act as financializing champions and as intermediaries connecting global finance and local sites, through advisory, valuation, brokerage, and lobbying. This contributes to understandings of the expanding global geographies of rental housing financialization and project ecologies behind urban production. Underscoring the power of private expertise to reconfigure housing markets recasts concerns surrounding market reliance as urban housing crisis salves."
Spatio-Temporal Analysis about Resource and Environmental Carrying Capacity (RECC) of Mining Cities in Coal-Concentrated Areas: A Case Study of Huaihai Economic Zone in China,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2717803f9dc019695dbb0a347139a8c2bd02e890,Shuai Tong; Xiang Ji; Yun Chu; Tianlong Liu; Fengyu Wang,"The over-exploitation and utilization of natural resources in mining cities has caused sharp contradictions between urban development and ecological protection. In addition, dynamic changes in resources and environmental carrying capacity (RECC) will be changed by the different ways and degrees of the specific utilization of natural resources. In order to better study the dynamic trends and reasons of the RECC in mining cities, so as to provide methods and suggestions for the mining cities to save resources, improve the ecology, and adjust the industrial structure, this article will construct an evaluation index for the RECC of mining cities. Taking Huaihai Economic Zone as the research object, we used the entropy method to determine the index weight. Then, the TOPSIS model was used to analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of the development of the RECC of mining cities in coal-concentrated areas during 2012–2018. After the analysis, the study found five results. (1) Except Zaozhuang, the RECC of the six mining cities in the Huaihai Economic Zone showed a steady upward trend during 2012–2018; (2) among the three subsystems, natural resources have the greatest impact on the RECC; (3) in terms of space, the carrying capacity in this region gradually has a polarization phenomenon centered on Xuzhou and Jining, and will continue to increase in the future; (4) the types of mining cities will have an impact on the change characteristics of the RECC; and (5) most cities improve the level of ecological carrying capacity (ECC) and social economic carrying capacity (SECC) at the cost of the decline of resources carrying capacity (RCC). Based on the results, the research can provide optimized reference strategies for the transformation and development of mining cities to ecological cities in Huaihai Economic Zone."
Mobilising environmental awareness through an environmental conservation-based communication model,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2717a58ee9e3d2b0d89b55500ca67e6c74d1c385,Ansar Suherman; L. M. J. Sirza; Wa Nur Fida; Hastuti Hastuti; Eko Satria; M. R. A. Putra; Jessy Muthia Ayu Ningtyas,"Climate change and environmental degradation on Buton Island require strong public awareness communication. This study develops an environmental conservation-based communication strategy using local wisdom to overcome the failure of standard approaches. A participatory action-based strategy was applied to 150 participants from six communities using a quasi-experimental design (intervention and control groups). Data gathering included the Environmental Awareness Index questionnaire, indepth interviews, participatory observation, and contextual educational material, including local legend modules. The intervention group had a significant rise in EAI score (Δ=26.3 points; p<0.001), notably in environmental practices (Δ=29.5). Women (65%) and older people (58%) participated most, prompted by traditional customs revitalization for conservation. This program cut coastal village plastic trash by 40% in four months, outperforming urban research. According to symbolic ecology theory, although not yet applied in literature, customary hierarchies and cultural symbols reinforce environmental messaging. These findings show that local wisdom-based models improve ecological awareness and socioecological resilience. The policy implications include island-region integration into sustainable tourism and comparable techniques. Further study is needed to test the influence of sustainability and model adaption in varied contexts."
MODERN ARCHITECTURAL FORMATION AND 3D PRINTING OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2727de9236a3f6c31d02543c259e1ebecf39f752,M. Votinov; O. Smirnova,"The article is devoted to the analysis and research of modern practical experience of designing residential objects in the urban environment. The conceptual foundations of the architectural design of modern residential buildings and complexes are considered. Features of modern architectural form-making and 3-D printing of residential objects are determined. It was determined that the architectural concepts of modern residential objects should be built based on the connection of several directions (ecology, urban planning, architecture of buildings and structures with the introduction of landscape design tools) and methods of modern shaping. It has been established that the shaping of modern residential objects is a process of implementing the design model of the building, which includes the choice of assembling form elements and subsystems of the building into a single system. It has been established that the architectural design of modern residential objects is based on the requirements and methods of creation that include: the algorithm of the process of forming the shape of a modern residential building, the interaction of subsystems of a residential building, the selection of the dominant subsystem with its reflection on the external form of the building, the type of basic form, the characteristic methods of forming the shape of a modern residential building, the compositional interaction between the elements of the architectural form of a modern residential building. The article pays attention to the modern theory of architectural space. The authors outline the ways of system improvement of modern residential buildings in the future. The impact of the latest technologies on the main parameters of modern residential objects has been revealed. Four directions of development of modern residential buildings and complexes in the urban environment in the future have been identified. These directions are related to the application of innovative technologies, new building materials, functional intensification of the infrastructure of the residential environment, creation of multifunctional residential objects, development of large-scale characteristics of buildings, use of natural components in the architectural design of modern residential objects. Prospective techniques for improving the formation of local residential units are defined.

 The tropical climate of Vietnam is characterized by the passage through the country of typhoons, which cause great damage to urban economy. In the period 19512013 years Vietnam has fallen 327 of typhoons, with an average of 56 per year. In 2018, 9 typhoons affecting Vietnam were recorded, causing nearly half abillion us dollars in damage and killing 70 people. One of the problems of Vietnams cities is damage to trees during typhoons. Root systems are often unable to keep trees in the soil under strong wind loads. When falling trees damaged cars, electric cables, destroyed houses and pavement, there are human casualties. About 300 species of plants are currently used for greening the cities of Vietnam. 10 of this composition is grown in large quantities and form the basis of urban tree plantations. The article analyzes the causes of falling and breaking of trees, highlighted the most dangerous species. According to the authors observations the most dangerous are just the most common in urban landscaping species. Four main causes of windfall and windbreak, which are associated with the ecology of species, planting methods and features of urban development, are considered. The paper discusses the need to remove anumber of dangerous tree species from the greening system and conduct acomprehensive study of the greening of cities exposed to the destructive action of typhoons, as well as the development of common standards for the selection of species composition and planting methods."
Focus on brown dog tick-transmitted Rocky Mountain spotted fever in dogs and people: shared threats and solutions.,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/272c9d285f1bd2723ecee9df78ad6b3244de4f49,Janet Foley; Laura H. Backus; Andrés M López-Pérez,"Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) kills people and dogs in rural communities throughout the Americas and in urban epidemics in Brazil and Mexico. The companion Currents in One Health by Foley et al, AJVR , March 2025, addresses the urban ecology of this devastating disease across the Americas. Cases acquired from Dermacentor spp ticks are sylvatic and sporadic, in contrast with peridomestic cases from Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, which relies on dogs as hosts. Since the early 2000s, RMSF reemerged in northern Mexico with at least 9,152 human cases and case mortality up to 50%. These cases tend to occur where people are impoverished and have marginal access to medical care. Data on RMSF in dogs are sparse, although dogs are sentinels for human risk. The presence of roaming dogs in neighborhoods is associated with human cases, canine seroprevalence, and tick abundance. Dogs and people share hematological and clinical chemical findings and results of targeted diagnostic tests. Diagnosis requires PCR confirmation or rising convalescent titers, although seropositivity can be a cross-reaction with other rickettsial organisms. Suspect cases should be treated with doxycycline immediately. Coinfection with other R sanguineus -transmitted pathogens is common. Veterinarians in clinical practice can help families manage RMSF risk with client education and provide tick preventive medication, although the considerable cost is a barrier. Veterinarians can also advise how to manage tick infestations in a home, recognizing that eradicating R. sanguineus is very difficult. To reduce roaming and canine population sizes, veterinarians should promote canine spay, neuter, and restraint to the home."
El lenguaje orgánico de Arturo Soria: antecedente de una ecología de la ciudad = The organic language of Arturo Soria: the antecedent of ecological urban planning,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27364eaaae5fbd10233c764ed7cb5e7cb9b81038,José Manuel de Andrés Moncayo,"ResumenEntre 1881 y 1883 Arturo Soria y Mata publicó una serie de artículos de temática urbana en el diario El Progreso en los que exponía los rudimentos de su teoría urbana y esbozaba su propuesta de Ciudad Lineal. En estos primeros escritos de Soria subyace una visión orgánica de los fenómenos urbanos que integra los procesos de consumo de materia y energía necesarios para el desarrollo de la vida urbana en un concepto a la vez único y complejo de ciudad. El desarrollo de esta metáfora orgánica conlleva para Soria y Mata el reconocimiento del metabolismo urbano como lugar de oportunidad y proyecto para la mejora de las condiciones de vida. El paralelismo entre organismo urbano y cuerpo humano es la clave de esta metodología operativa mediante la que el autor concibe avanzados sistemas de abastecimiento, comunicaciones o recogida de deshechos basados en el potencial de las nuevas tecnologías para organizar y mejorar las ciudades de su tiempo. De esta visión nacerá su propuesta definitiva de crecimiento urbano, la Ciudad Lineal, llamada a establecer una red residencial que conectará los núcleos de las ciudades existentes preservados como centros de negocios y disfrute. El pensamiento orgánico de Soria es un antecedente histórico relevante para la consolidación de una ecología urbana. Su estudio y reivindicación aspira a reconciliar los retos y aspiraciones urbanas contemporáneas con un capítulo menospreciado de los fundamentos del urbanismo moderno.AbstractBetween 1881 and 1883, Arturo Soria y Mata published a series of articles on urban issues in the newspaper El Progreso, in which he exposed the roots of his urban theory and outlined his proposal for a Linear City. In these first writings, the organic vision of the urban phenomena developed by Soria integrates the processes of consumption of matter and energy necessary for urban life in a concept of the city that is both unique and complex. The development of this organic metaphor entails the recognition of urban metabolism as an opportunity for improving living conditions. The parallelism between the urban organism and the human body is the key of this operational methodology, through which the author conceives advanced supply, communications or waste collection systems based on the potential of new technologies to organize and improve the cities of his time. It was from this vision that his definitive proposal for urban growth was born, the Linear City, which was fated to establish a residential network that connected the core of the existing cities, preserved as business and leisure centers. Soria’s organic thinking is an important historical precedent to the consolidation of an urban ecology. The purpose of studying and advocating it is to reconcile contemporary urban challenges and aspirations with an underrated chapter of the foundations of modern urban theory."

Predictors of free-roaming domestic dogs' contact network centrality and their relevance for rabies control,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27421f3f5e4c2d662f1cb26336ddb5da23c385fe,Charlotte Warembourg; G.

Maximiano Sousa; Abakar Naminou; Pablo Roquel; S. Hartnack; J. Zinsstag; S. Dürr,"Free roaming domestic dogs (FRDD) are the main vectors for rabies transmission to humans worldwide. To eradicate rabies from a dog population, current recommendations focus on random vaccination with at least 70% coverage. Studies suggest that targeting high-risk subpopulations could reduce the required vaccination coverage, and increase the likelihood of success of elimination campaigns. The centrality of a dog in a contact network can be used as a measure of its potential contribution to disease transmission. Our objectives were to investigate social networks of FRDD in eleven study sites in Chad, Guatemala, Indonesia and Uganda, and to identify characteristics of dogs, and their owners, associated with their centrality in the networks. In all study sites, networks had small-world properties and right-skewed degree distributions, suggesting that vaccinating highly connected dogs would be more effective than random vaccination. Dogs were more connected in rural than urban settings, and the likelihood of contacts was negatively correlated with the distance between dogs’ households. While heterogeneity in dog's connectedness was observed in all networks, factors predicting centrality and likelihood of contacts varied across networks and countries. We therefore hypothesize that the investigated dog and owner characteristics resulted in different contact patterns depending on the social, cultural and economic context. We suggest to invest into understanding of the sociocultural structures impacting dog ownership and thus driving dog ecology, a requirement to assess the potential of targeted vaccination in dog populations."
Governing by entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurial ecosystems and socio-spatial difference,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2747c5c3804f548d0e43e908cbde116590900b61,Julian B Hartman; Mark Kear,"Literature on entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) has grown rapidly over the past 5 years, using the concept as a framework to understand regional clusters of entrepreneurship. This article reviews, critiques, and extends the concept of the EE, arguing for its relevance in studying the political economy of urban space. To make this argument, we distinguish between niche EEs (NEEs) and growth EEs (GEEs). This distinction is based on the overlapping but distinct networks of actors and institutions forming each type of EE and also reflects broadly different relationships to growth and productivity, the entrepreneurial subject, global and local scales, and financial ecologies. We argue that EE research has largely focused on GEEs to the neglect of NEEs; by broadening the EE concept, we address shortcomings in the treatment of small businesses, financial relations, social difference, as well as urban politics within the EE literature. Drawing on the EE literature and interviews from a case study of Boston, we show that the infrastructure of GEEs and NEEs are not only “for” fast- and slow-growing businesses, respectively, but reinforce social and economic differences. While NEEs do redistribute resources to marginalized entrepreneurs, these resources are focused on building businesses and only indirectly related to the needs of marginalized communities and equitable development more generally."
Spatiotemporal Evolution of Urban Shrinkage and Its Impact on Urban Resilience in Three Provinces of Northeast China,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27584bd1708329bcc2f1e579e4cdd9f78643abed,Shangkun Yu; Ruili Wang; Xue-jiao Zhang; Yi Miao; Chengxin Wang,"Currently, Chinese cities are experiencing both overall growth and localized shrinkage. Therefore, it becomes crucial to quantify urban shrinkage and explore the transformation and sustainable development of shrinking cities from the perspective of urban resilience. This study focuses on the three provinces of Northeast China, which are representative areas of urban shrinkage, as its research subjects. Employing the analytic hierarchy process, a comprehensive evaluation system for urban shrinkage is constructed based on three dimensions: population, economy, and space. Furthermore, urban resilience is scientifically measured from four aspects: economy, society, ecology, and infrastructure. The study analyzes the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of urban shrinkage and urban resilience in the three northeastern provinces from 2012 to 2018. It also examines the impact of urban shrinkage on urban resilience through regression analysis and mediation models. The results indicate the following: (1) Half of the cities in the three northeastern provinces experienced shrinkage, although the extent of shrinkage decreased with the implementation of the Northeast China revitalization strategy. Population-related shrinkage was the most extensive and continued to expand, while economy-related shrinkage was the most severe, and space-related shrinkage was the least severe. (2) The resilience of shrinking cities was lower than the average level. Population-shrinking cities and economy-shrinking cities exhibited low levels of economic resilience, and the gap between them continued to widen. Space-shrinking cities generally had low infrastructure resilience. (3) The urban shrinkage index had a significant positive impact on the urban resilience index, mediated through intermediary variables, such as innovation capability and cultural development. Notably, both the direct and indirect effects of innovation capability were the greatest. Population-related shrinkage had the largest impact on urban resilience, while more intermediary variables of economy-related shrinkage passed the significance test."
"Urban Flows, Movements and Conflict: Negotiating Perceived and Real Precariousness",2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/275b35402ba2018858399e7ad6d01393f941bb59,Åse Ottosson,"A substantial literature has recently emerged inside and beyond the discipline of anthropology concerning various aspects of a ‘precarious present’ in a globalised world (e.g. Banki 2013; Hinkson 2017; Weston 2012). Tellingly, at the biggest annual gathering of anthropologists in the world in 2017, the American Anthropological Association’s annual meeting, references to real situations and analytical notions of ‘precarity’ abounded in the many panels. Derivative concepts such as ‘contingency’, ‘vulnerability’, ‘risk’, ‘radical uncertainty’, ‘unpredictability’, ‘beyond crisis’ and ‘resilience’ were likewise frequently heard. This is hardly surprising, not only because of the current political climate in the host country under the presidency of Donald Trump, but also due to the steadily growing concerns about the social and cultural consequences of global climate change (e.g. Marshall and Connor 2015), as well as academic critique and social movements that question the dominance of neoliberal discourses in shaping ever more extreme forms of inequality and exploitation across the world (Harvey 2005; Povinelli 2011). Indeed, it may be appropriate to frame our ethnographic analyses of people’s lives in terms of ‘political ecologies of the precarious’ (Weston 2012: 429). It is worth keeping in mind, however, that anthropologists have long observed, described and analysed lived experiences of unpredictability, uncertainty and vulnerability to exploitation, as well as resilience and sustainability, and how these factors inherently shape people’s day-to-day social and cultural practice as well as the human condition more broadly (Beck 1992; Butler 2006; During 2015; Ettlinger 2007; Standing 2011). As Kathleen Stewart sets out to demonstrate, precarity can also be seen as intrinsic to anthropologists’ very writing of ethnography of emergent social and cultural phenomena, as we generate representations of ‘their plurality, movement, imperfection, immanence, incommensurateness, the way that they accrete, accrue and wear out’ (2012: 518)."
Analysis of Walkability of Historical Blocks of Shanghai Old City Area Based on Spatial Syntax,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/275bbc6fff101df0f27051bc90c645b9adcc6d39,R.

The measurement of the pedestrian environment is an important premise of urban planning and construction, and an important indicator to measure social ecology and pedestrian safety. From the perspective of spatial syntax, this paper selects four parameter values, namely connection value, global integration degree, local integration degree and comprehensibility degree, to quantitatively analyses the spatial structure and road network characteristics of blocks, and to explore the walkability of blocks from the topological structure itself. The empirical research object is Shanghai Old City area, which is the cradle of Shanghai-style culture and the window to show the historical accumulation and traditional culture of Shanghai to foreign tourists. Through the research and analysis, it provides a theoretical basis for further optimizing the walking experience of historical districts and updating the planning and design of road space."

Urban Expansion Assessment Based on Optimal Granularity in the Huaihe River Basin of China,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/277912dc3411e77d686af861eaa82d83aa269026,Xuning Qiao; Liang Liu; Yongju Yang; Y. Gu; Jinchan Zheng,"Determining the optimal granularity, which has often been ignored in the analysis of urban expansion and its landscape pattern, is the core problem in landscape ecology research. Here, we calculate the optimal granularities for differently sized cities in the Huaihe River Basin of China based on scale transformation and area loss evaluation. Accordingly, we construct a landscape index and urban land density function to analyze urban expansion and landscape pattern. The results can be summarized as follows. (1) Within the first scale domain of the landscape indices, the optimal granularities of Zhengzhou, Xuzhou, Yancheng, Xinyang, and Bozhou are 60 m, 50 m, 40 m, 40 m, and 40 m, respectively, which are the optimal units in the study of urban expansion. (2) The urban land density decreases from the urban center to the outskirts, the urban core of each city is more compact than the outskirts, and the land density curve parameter α of Zhengzhou is the largest at 4.693 and its urban core the most compact. (3) There are significant spatial and temporal differences in the urban land densities of differently sized cities. The urban land density functions of different cities are similar before 2000; after that, they are similar to the standard inverse S-shaped function and the land use density curve of large cities is closer to the standard inverse S-shaped function than that of small- and medium-sized cities. (4) Large cities have faster expansion, much larger land density curve parameter c than medium- and small-cities, stronger linkage development with surrounding areas, and a higher degree of urban centralization. Urban expansion compactness was influenced by urban locations and functions except for urban sizes. This study offers a method for identifying the optimal granularities for differently sized cities and also provides information for the decision-making efforts that concern the rapid urbanization in major grain-producing areas of China."
Tree species identity and forest composition affect the number of oak processionary moth captured in pheromone traps and the intensity of larval defoliation,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2788a305b085ee152ce224e692cf37a06f2c2674,Thomas Damestoy; H. Jactel; T. Belouard; Hubert Schmuck; C. Plomion; B. Castagneyrol,"Pure forests are often seen as being more prone to damage by specialist pest insects than mixed forests, and particularly mixed forests associating host and nonhost species. We addressed the effect of tree diversity on oak colonization and defoliation by a major specialist pest, the oak processionary moth (OPM) We quantified the number of male OPM moths captured and larval defoliation in pure stands of two oak host species (Quercus robur and Quercus petraea) and in mixed stands associating the two oak species or each oak species with another nonhost broadleaved species. We conducted two complementary studies to test the effect of host species and stand composition: (i) we used pheromone trapping to compare the number of males OPM captured throughout the distribution of oak hosts in France and (ii) we noted the presence of OPM nests and estimated defoliation in mature forests of north‐eastern France. Oak species and stand composition significantly influenced the number of male OPM captured and defoliation by OPM larvae. Quercus petraea was consistently more attractive to and more defoliated by OPM than Q. robur. Both oak trees were attacked more in pure stands than in mixed stands, in particular mixed stands associating oaks with another (nonhost) broadleaved species. The results of the present study support the view that mixed forests are more resistant to specialist pest insects than pure stands, and also indicate that this trend depends on forest composition. Our study provides new insights into OPM ecology and has potential implications for forest management, including the management of urban forests where OPM causes serious human health issues."
Political Ecology,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2798a2cf31edc0c0c27cb9fbc0ae3a2e789ead5c,Jason Roberts,"Political ecology is a critical research field within anthropology and related disciplines that examines how and why economic structures and power relations drive environmental change in an increasingly interconnected world. Initially it was most wellknown for investigating the practices and impacts of large-scale resource development projects in subsistence-oriented communities in the Global South. Over time, political ecology has expanded its research trajectory to include analyses of environmental politics and socio-ecological degradation in urban, industrialised settings as well. This entry outlines the historical development of political ecology in order to understand the bases for its common theoretical assumptions, research themes, methodological approaches, and sources of critique. In doing so, it provides particular insight into the important ways that anthropologists have influenced, and been influenced by, political ecology. Though individual research interests and emphases have expanded since the early days of political ecology, the field continues to provide a valuable means for tracing the broader structural forces of socio-ecological change to a thorough understanding of the impacts and responses to that change at the local level. Yet, as an inherently interdisciplinary field, the challenge for political ecology continues to revolve around properly integrating its various disciplinary interests and influences into a consistent framework capable of analysing political, cultural, and ecological matters with sufficient rigor. Political ecologists’ on-going efforts to meet this challenge have never been more important than they are today, as the world increasingly struggles with interrelated issues such as global climate change, industrial pollution, resource degradation, economic dispossession, and changing patterns of environmental health."

To pursue the comprehensive development of economy and ecology, it is very important to analyze the ecological environment in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. Here, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region was selected as the research area, and 19 indicators were selected to construct an evolution system based on the PSRM model. The temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of ecological vulnerability in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region were explored by combining the order relation method, CRITIC method, Theil index, and hot spot analysis, and the influencing factors were calculated via geographic detector. The results showed that:① the ecological vulnerability first increased and then decreased in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. The vulnerable areas showed a northeast-southwest trend, and the ecological environment in the northeast and southwest regions was better than that in the central and southern regions. The area of slight vulnerability in 2014 increased by 6803.01 km2 compared with that in 2009. The area of mild vulnerability decreased by 130.41 km2, and the area of moderate vulnerability decreased by 26537.31 km2 compared with that in 2009. The areas of severe and extremely vulnerable status increased by 19512.9 km2 and 351.81 km2, respectively, compared with those in 2009. The habitat situation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region improved significantly from 2014 to 2019. Compared with that in 2014, the areas of mild, moderate, severe, and extremely vulnerable decreased by 2248.29 km2, 2220.21 km2, 7988.67 km2, and 55.98 km2, respectively. The light area increased by 12513.15 km2 compared with that in 2014. ② According to the calculation results of the Theil index, the spatial correlation degree of ecological vulnerability in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region exhibited a V-shaped fluctuation, and the spatial pattern of the cold and hot areas was predominantly consistent with that of the vulnerability. ③ Biological abundance, PM10, and the human disturbance index had a significant influence on the spatial differentiation of ecological vulnerability in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. Based on the results of ecological vulnerability analysis, some suggestions on the ecological environment and sustainable development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region were proposed."
Foraging movements of breeding Kelp Gulls in South Africa,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27c23a996e9a41b6d5cf666a4fcc85780868a990,Katharina Reusch; N. Suárez; P. Ryan; L. Pichegru,"Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus are one of the most abundant gulls in the Southern Hemisphere and can play an important role in their ecosystem. Understanding their foraging ecology is therefore important, especially in the context of anthropogenic changes of the environment. Over 35,000 Kelp Gulls breed in South Africa but little is known about their habitat use. It has been hypothesised that foraging mainly occurs in natural habitats while provisioning chicks to ensure high quality food, but knowledge on their foraging ecology during the incubation period remains poor. We tracked incubating Kelp Gulls from six colonies distributed along the coast of South Africa, varying in their distance to urban areas and landfills, and compared foraging trip patterns and habitat selection between colonies. Gulls from west coast colonies, generally located further from landfills than the other studied colonies, travelled farther from their breeding sites (11.7 ± 9.9–17.8 ± 21.7 km, n = 3 colonies) than birds from Cape Town and south and east coast colonies (1.7 ± 0.8–3.1 ± 3.7 km, n = 3) with birds travelling farthest when foraging at sea. Gulls from all colonies spent more time foraging in marine, coastal, and natural terrestrial environments than scavenging in strongly modified habitats while incubating. Our results suggest that Kelp Gulls in South Africa are able to exploit various resources from different foraging habitats, regardless of colony location and seem to rely less on anthropogenic habitats than expected."

Murtha; Madeline Brown,"Central Florida has experienced sustained and substantial urban land expansion over the last half-century. In Florida, urban expansion intersects natural and human systems. Investigating the relationship between landscape conditions and urbanization processes in Central Florida, therefore, requires a critical assessment of local natural and human conditions through time. In this paper, we examine the relationship between urbanization and landscape patterns through the lens of urban public parks. As a vital component of landscapes, parks reveal patterns and processes that influence landscape ecology in urban settlements (TURNER 1989). To better understand the multiple influences of natural and human factors on park design and planning, this paper introduces the idea of a park suitability index (PSI), which is targeted at quantifying the form, function and distribution of parks as they compare to settlement patterns. Critically, the PSI combines multiple measures into a single comparative metric for informing land use planning and landscape design for urban parks. Using a sample of 12 Orlando parks and a subset of variables, we develop the framework for a methodology that defines key parameters of the PSI for use in urban design and planning. Specifically, we evaluate the influence of urbanization patterns on park resource availability and diversity. In addition, we examine community-level functions of parks by considering the form and distribution of parks as compared to settlement patterns. These analyses provide the baseline for developing a more generalizable PSI for use in landscape planning both in Florida and elsewhere."
House dust mites: the insidious symbiosis,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27c9de7208ddf186b84e960438c999adf740ca6a,S. I. Bardenikova; T. I. Rychkova; E. V. Kulikova; O. B. Dovgun; T. Belyaeva,"Aim: to assess changes in the patterns of sensitization to house dust allergens in a cohort of children with allergic disorders over the last 30 years. Patients and Methods: this retrospective analysis included 26,343 protocols of allergy tests to house dust and its allergenic components (house mix, D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae mites, library dust) that had been carried out in children 4–18 years old over the period from 1989 to 2019. Skin testing was performed using the generally accepted scarification technique on the anterior surface of the forearm through a drop of the tested allergen. Then, the test results are assessed by visual inspection with a score of 1 — 4. The results of continuous monitoring were summarized and statistically processed for all years of the observation period, but the article presents analysis of the ""cross-section"" indicators only for those years that were convenient for comparison. The authors calculated a percentage ratio of the number of patients sensitized to the studied allergen to the total number of patients tested for hypersensitivity to this allergen during a particular year. Then, they compared the percentage of patients with low (1–2) and high (3–4) scores. Results and Discussion: the analysis showed a steady increase in IgE hypersensitivity to the house dust mix (from 23.7% in 1989 to 71.2% in 2019). Also, it demonstrated an increase in the degree of sensitization (3 — 4 scores) to the integral dust mix (from 4.2% in 1989 to 16.6% in 2019), which was significantly higher than that to the dust mites themselves due to the diverse composition of specific proteins of epidermal, fungal, bacterial, and insect origin that can induce antibodies independently on each other. There was a similar 2.6-fold growth in sensitization to the library dust over the first 10 years of observation, and by 2019 hypersensitization developed in 57.2% of children from this cohort. However, a dramatic decline in high scores (3–4) of the detected level to 5% was reported in 2019 which was associated with the changes in the ways of in-house data storage. Conclusion: the study findings provide a rationale for the mandatory control of dynamic changes in sensitization among children with allergic disorders using an expended household allergen panel. The steady increase in sensitization to house dust allergens confirms a low effectiveness of elimination measures and suggests a progressive immune imbalance under the everyday pressure of urban ecology.

However, with their increasing prevalence, ethical issues arise concerning the use of video data and the impact of these systems on privacy and citizens' rights. In this article, we will delve into some of these issues in detail and propose recommendations for their resolution. It is important to recognize the consequences that video surveillance and monitoring can have on the quality and effectiveness of decisions made by people. This problem proves to be quite relevant in various fields, including manufacturing, engineering, and others. Video surveil-lance and monitoring have become an integral part of the modern world, particularly in the areas of security, transportation, urban planning, and ecology, with the aid of advanced video analysis and data processing technologies. Today's video surveillance systems provide a high level of information support for decision-making, which is why we will explore the key aspects of information technology that support decision-making in video surveillance and monitoring tasks, as well as the prospects and challenges of its application."

Residential area is closely related to human health and its development is a symbol of urban progress. The planning and design of green ecological residential area has become the focus of common concern in China and even in the world. Based on the concept of green ecology, this paper discusses how to plan and design residential roads and landscape. At the end of this paper, the design method of road and landscape in residential area is analysed through practical application design. It is hoped to provide some reference ideas for future residential planning and jointly promote the construction of green ecology of residential area."

In this study, we use satellite observations from 2000–2021 to explore the evolving impact of SES interactions on the UTE of 136 Chinese urban areas. The results reveal a nonlinear intensification of the UTE over the period and an indication that an increasing number of urban areas have successfully applied UTE mitigation measures. Spatio-temporal patterns in UTE are shown to be strongly influenced by social and ecological factors and their interactions, whereby the higher the SES status, the stronger the decreasing UTE trend. These findings highlight the need for, and advantages of, developing win-win solutions for urban society and ecology and have important implications in creating integrated strategies for heat mitigation in promoting urban sustainability."

Landscape Pattern Evolution in a Mining Citiy: An Urban Life Cycle Perspective,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27fc39cbaa8abbd183a7ef521a04940a53c9a0a4,Yuhang Shang; Xin Ye; Lun Dong; Shiming Liu; Tiantian Du; Guan Wang,"Quantitative studies on how mining activities shape the evolution of regional landscape patterns can contribute to the scientific understanding of how mining cities develop. Based on the theories of life cycle and landscape ecology, this paper takes Jixi, a typical Chinese mining city, as a case study to analyze the landscape pattern features at different mining city development stages. First, we constructed a mining city development cycle index system. Second, the optimal granularity for landscape pattern analysis was determined. Finally, landscape evolution was analyzed at the type and landscape levels based on the mining city development cycle. The main conclusions are: (1) Jixi has gone through four stages since 1990: lead-in (1990–1998), development (1998–2009), maturity (2009–2016), and transition (2016–2020); (2) the optimal grain size for landscape pattern analysis is 90 m; (3) through the various development stages, the landscape fragmentation degree, complexity, and diversity show a tendency to rise first and then fall. Thus, mining cities should carry out sustainable development planning from the perspective of industrial transformation in the early stages, and policy orientation in the development process should have different emphases according to each stage."

Tropospheric vertical column densities (VCDs) of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) retrieved from sun-synchronous satellite instruments have provided abundant NO2 data for environmental studies, but such data are limited by retrieval uncertainties and insufficient temporal sampling (e.g., once a day). The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) launched in February 2020 monitors NO2 at an
unprecedented hourly resolution during the daytime. Here we present a research product for tropospheric NO2 VCDs, referred to as
POMINO–GEMS (where POMINO is the Peking University OMI NO2 algorithm). We develop a hybrid retrieval method combining GEMS, TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) and GEOS-CF (Global Earth Observing System Composition Forecast) data to generate hourly tropospheric NO2 slant column densities (SCDs). We then derive tropospheric NO2 air mass factors (AMFs) with explicit corrections for surface reflectance anisotropy and aerosol optical effects through parallelized pixel-by-pixel radiative transfer calculations. Prerequisite cloud parameters are retrieved with the O2–O2 algorithm by using ancillary parameters consistent with those used in NO2 AMF calculations. The initial retrieval of POMINO–GEMS tropospheric NO2 VCDs for June–August 2021 exhibits strong hotspot signals over megacities and
distinctive diurnal variations over polluted and clean areas. POMINO–GEMS NO2 VCDs agree with the POMINO–TROPOMI v1.2.2 product (R=0.98; NMB = 4.9 %) over East Asia, with slight differences associated with satellite viewing geometries and cloud and aerosol properties affecting the NO2 retrieval. POMINO–GEMS also shows good agreement with the following: OMNO2 (Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) NO2 Standard Product) v4 (R=0.87; NMB = −16.8 %); and GOME-2 (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2) GDP (GOME Data Processor) 4.8 (R=0.83; NMB = −1.5 %) NO2 products. POMINO–GEMS shows small biases against ground-based MAX-DOAS (multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy) NO2 VCD data at nine sites (NMB = −11.1 %), with modest or high correlation in diurnal variation at six urban and suburban sites
(R from 0.60 to 0.96). The spatiotemporal variation in POMINO–GEMS correlates well with mobile car MAX-DOAS measurements in the Three Rivers
source region on the Tibetan Plateau (R=0.81). Surface NO2 concentrations estimated from POMINO–GEMS VCDs are consistent with measurements from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China for spatiotemporal variation (R=0.78; NMB = −26.3 %) and diurnal variation at all, urban, suburban and rural sites (R≥0.96). POMINO–GEMS data will be made freely available for users to study the spatiotemporal variations, sources and impacts of NO2.

Using complex network analysis to assess the ecological security network for a rapid urbanization region in China,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28140fc2cd1ca0f21dba8389670de25a94b75339,De Zhou; Zhulu Lin; T. Yan; Jialing Qi; Wenyu Zhong,"A sound ecological security network (ESN) promotes the interconnection
of ecological sources, improves the pattern of ecological security, and
alleviates the degradation of an ecosystem. Rapid urbanization and land
use changes may lead to serious fragmentation and islanding of landscape
patches and further to deep disturbance of regional ESNs. However, most
studies in the recent years focused on the methodological development of
ESN identification, reconstruction, and optimization, but lacked the
systematic assessment of the network after its construction. The purpose
of this study is to use complex network analysis to systematically
assess the constructed ESN for the urban agglomeration around Hangzhou
(UAHB), a rapid urbanization region in China. By integrating landscape
ecology theory, graph theory, and complex network analysis, we
abstracted the ESN into a topological network and developed an index
system to assess the abstracted network, which was based on the
structural elements of the topological network (nodes, edges, and the
overall network). Our results show that the connectivity and stability
of the UAHB’s ESN have been improved in the last 20 years, although
isolated nodes are still existing in the ESN. Our study also shows that
the network’s robustness under human disturbance has been affected more
than that under non-human disturbance. Finally, we proposed five
optimization strategies from the perspective of topological structure
and ecological function to maintain a sustainable and well-protected
ecological system."

The Russian eco-tourism market has a high potential for growth due to the lack of significant competition. With appropriate investments, the natural conditions and diversity of cultural and historical sites will make it possible to make original routes interesting for travelers, which will enjoy stable demand. The lack of infrastructure significantly hampers development of eco-tourism in protected areas. The socio-economic aspect of eco-tourism has a significant impact on local budgets. At the regional level, attempts are made to organize tourism activities, but the effectiveness of such initiatives differs significantly in terms of the actors. The national project «Ecology» has united about a dozens of federal projects. They involve solving the tasks aimed at improving the environmental situation, increasing the area of the special protected areas, providing them with the necessary infrastructure, as well as stimulating the development of knowledge and environmental tourism, carrying out active educational work and development of surrounding areas. The article deals with the phenomenon of ecological tourism, analyzes the peculiarity and potential possibilities of implementation of tourist activity in specially protected areas of the republic. The factors restraining the development of tourism are identified, and the mechanisms promoting more active involvement of specially protected natural areas in the region's tourism activities are determined. The authors in the study used a wide range of methods: system analysis, case study, comparative and statistical analysis, and the sociological method."

Ahmed; R. Alam; Md Safiur Rahman; Zhixiao Xie,"
 The study aims to achieve an accurate assessment of 7 heavy metals, including Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Ni, Pb and Cd. Data were collected from 15 sampling stations and analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The potential detrimental effects of these heavy metals were evaluated by Hakanson risk index. Hakanson risk index (RI) and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) and the ecological risk were articulated as probability distribution of Risk Index values instead of single point values to estimate the uncertainties in the risk evaluation process. The results showed that the levels of SEF (sediment enrichment factor) in the sediments were in the following order: Ni > Pb > Cd > Mn > Cu > Zn. Geo-accumulation index (Igeo) values showed no pollution for most of the metals except Ni, which portrayed the sediment was moderately contaminated and may have adverse effects on the ecology of the river. RI values from Hakanson Risk Index showed each individual station are at low ecological risks throughout the study area. According to the Monte Carlo simulation results and the traditional Hakanson risk index, the cumulative probability of Risk Index (RI) values is less than 150, which, according to the Hakanson risk index, represents low ecological risk. From the sensitivity analysis, the comparatively highest contribution to variance can be ranked as Cd > Pb > Ni > Zn > Cu. The outputs of this study could be used to assess ecological risk near urban area river sediment and help predict how the disposal of domestic sewage will affect the riverine ecosystem."
Environmental cultures: review of ‘the new poetics of climate change’ and ‘climate crisis and the 21st-century British novel’,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/286031fdda6f55e2b1f7a1e530fad2339a81bd1a,Neal Alexander,"Since 2017, Bloomsbury’s Environmental Cultures series (edited by Greg Garrard and Richard Kerridge) has published no fewer than 18 titles on topics ranging from ‘nerd ecology’ and ‘ecospectrality’ to climate scepticism and the cultural history of fuel. This is one of the leading edges of ecocriticism, which has transformed itself in recent years from a neo-Romantic defence of nature writing to a more sophisticated, self-aware and increasingly materialist mode of critical discourse. Sometimes adventurously inter-disciplinary, ecocriticism remains primarily a mode of literarycritical analysis, but the scope of its attention to various kinds of literary texts and literary histories has expanded well beyond canonical figures such as Wordsworth and Thoreau. A pronounced focus on the cultural implications of climate crisis has also led to a wide range of productive engagements with research in the sciences, social sciences and philosophy. Astrid Bracke’s and Matthew Griffiths’s new books in the series are each concerned to explore the ways in which literary texts might contribute to our ability to imagine and comprehend the implications of climate crisis, while also acknowledging the limits of representation and human understanding. Bracke’s focus is upon 21st-century British novels, and her methodology synthesises elements of ecocriticism and narratology, examining four key narratives concerning climate crisis in a dozen selected texts: tales of environmental collapse, versions of pastoral, stories of urban nature and accounts of polar expeditions. Her core argument is simple, if perhaps a bit vague: 21st-century British novels both reflect a general ‘cultural awareness’ of climate crisis and also seek to ‘renegotiate the stories we tell about it’ (p. 135). At base, this amounts to little more than a restatement of the fundamental dialectic of tradition and innovation that informs all literary production. However, Bracke’s local discussions of her four key narratives are typically more detailed and suggestive. For instance, she makes a very useful distinction between ‘apocalyptic narratives’ and narratives of ‘environmental collapse’ (p. 24) and goes on to show that the latter tend to feature a metafictional commentary on the erosion of language in contexts of climate crisis (p. 42). There is also a fascinating analysis of the thematic and symbolic significance of food in urban novels, where Bracke argues persuasively that phenomena such as farmers’ markets mediate the human characters’ relationship to (or alienation from) the natural world in ways that are highly dependent on class position and socioeconomic status (p. 96). Even the rather over-familiar topic of pastoral is enlivened by a discussion of ‘pastoral traces’ (p. 69), which undermine the distinctions between city and country, retreat and return; and in her chapter on polar narratives, Bracke 884934 CGJ0010.1177/1474474019884934cultural geographiesbook review essay research-article2019"

He called for national regulation to insure food purity and safety standards. Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle also raised the issue for meat processing. The result was the adoption of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and the Meat Inspection Act. Nutrition science influenced the government’s new regulations insuring food’s safety and freedom from contaminants and adulteration. The role of middle-class white women was also important in this era as women were represented as keepers of the home and regenerators of the nation. They were also activists in consumer organizations calling for the regulation of milk purity and food labeling standards. In the final case, Haydu focuses upon the 1960s and 1970s of the organic food movement and highlights Robert Rodale’s challenge to the conventional food system. Robert Rodale’s Organic Gardening and Farming advocated organic living and natural lifestyles in the early 1970s and valued healthy soil, pure water, and clean air and a nonmaterialistic rural way of life. Rodale Press published numerous titles about organic farming, gardening, and simpler life styles eschewing processed foods and overconsumption of material goods. Gardeners and small farmers were a part of this movement as were students and parents with children who were anxious about the adulteration of milk and other foods by hormones and pesticide residues. Echoing the Grahamites’ dedication to good food, organic food activists also brought environmental and social sustainability into the discussions and responses to industrial food systems. There was a push to democratize science to serve people and communities, not just corporations. Growing good food as well as consuming good food became an important part of this movement which encompassed well-being and resisted the globalization of agriculture and food through an alignment with the anti-globalization movement. As in the previous eras, this was largely a white middle-class movement. Questions of agrarian change, class, race, sexism, privilege, inequity, exclusion, and dispossession are raised and examined in food studies research over the last 20 years. These extensions of the politics of food to broader political and social issues moves beyond consumer food politics to questions about capitalist development, colonialism, and neoliberal policy and politics. Haydu makes this point as well in the book’s conclusion, by noting that a focus upon white middle-class food consumption is narrow and vulnerable to co-optation by the conventional agro-food system. More recent national and international food movements have focused upon a plurality of socio-political questions involving equity and justice and ecology, while taking into account questions of hunger, food access, and power. I recommend this book to readers interested in the history of urban white middle-class food consumption politics in the United States and in understanding the roles of consumer social movements and their relationships in food regimes within American history."

In this network, the actuators and sensors smoothly interact with our environment as data is exchanged across platforms to provide a unified operational view. Near field communication (NFC) is the upcoming technology that will enable the transformation of the worldwide web into a fully integrated Future Internet. This technology is being advanced through the adoption of variousenabling device methods, such as tags, audience members, encased sense and actuators nodes, and nodes for near field interaction. The demand for data-on-demand, using complex and straightforward queries, increases significantly as studies transition from web to web2 to web3.

This may require innovative technological ideas to efficiently and judiciously utilize the limited urban space. Air quality mapping using Geographic Information System (GIS) provides one such effective tool to urban planners to identify and target specific areas for air quality management in urban setting. In the present study, the air quality mapping of a well-planned city of Chandigarh (India) with proper environmental management zoning has revealed that the air quality index (AQI) of the city falls under “Moderately Polluted (101-200)” category primarily due to annual average concentrations of  (range: 44.17-68.87; overall: 56.64) and  (range: 99.32-129.39; overall: 111.92) being higher than the permissible levels of  40   and 60  respectively as per Indian standards at all locations as well as for overall city. The study has identified vehicular traffic as the primary reason responsible for the moderately polluted air quality of the city that has the highest vehicle density (878 per 1,000 population) in India. The paper has also suggested measures that may be incorporated during designing and developing the physical and social infrastructures in the city so as to judiciously and efficiently utilize the limited urban space."

The attraction of remote sensing (RS) allows spatially integrated information for vast territories with time minimization, but it requires a system of regional reference (etalon) polygons for adequate proceeding of RS data. Such a system has been developed since 2016 by specialists in the field of ecology, botany and geoinformatics at Samara University.The work implementation in 2016-2022 was carried out in two directions: - formation of a regional system of ground reference plots (etalons) that provide work with RS data; - assessment of the possibilities for the UAVsuse for monitoring of plant communities state, previously carried out exclusively by ground-based methods. The main result of our joint efforts is regionally adjusted classifiers that allow the most efficient processing of available remote sensing materials corresponding to various types of natural and anthropogenically transformed vegetation areas of the Samara region. We also confirmed the point of view on the high efficiency of using UAVs to identify and analyze the state of anthropogenically transformed and natural areas, including small natural objects.Thus, joining the efforts of specialists in various fields and integrating classical and innovative technologies is the most realistic way to study, monitor, and conserve regional phytodiversity."

ABSTRACT Replication-associated protein (Rep)-encoding single-stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses comprise viruses with covalently closed, circular, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes, and are considered the smallest known autonomously replicating, capsid-encoding animal pathogens. CRESS DNA viruses (phylum Cressdnaviricota) encompass several viral families including Circoviridae. Circoviruses are classified into two genera, Circovirus and Cyclovirus, and they are known to cause fatal diseases in birds and pigs. Circoviruses have also been identified in human stools, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as in various wild and domestic vertebrates, including reptiles. The synanthropic presence of Squamata reptiles has increased in the last century due to the anthropic pressure, which has shifted forested animal behavior to an urban and peri-urban adaptation. In this paper, we explored the diversity of CRESS DNA viruses in Squamata reptiles from different Italian areas representative of the Mediterranean basin. CRESS DNA viruses were detected in 31.7% (33/104) of sampled lizards and geckoes. Different CRESS DNA viruses likely reflected dietary composition or environmental contamination and included avian-like (n = 3), dog (n = 4), bat-like (n = 1), goat-like (n = 1), rodent-like (n = 4), and insect-like (n = 2) viruses. Rep sequences of at least two types of human-associated cycloviruses (CyV) were identified consistently, regardless of geographic location, namely, TN9-like (n = 11) and TN12-like (n = 6). A third human-associated CyV, TN25-like, was detected in a single sample. The complete genome of human-like CyVs, of a rodent-like, insect-like, and of a bat-like virus were generated. Collectively, the results recapitulate hosts dietary and environmental sources of exposure and may suggest unexpected ecological niches for some CRESS DNA viruses. IMPORTANCE CRESS DNA viruses are significant pathogens of birds and pigs and have been detected repeatedly in human samples (stools, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid), both from healthy individuals and from patients with neurological disease, eliciting in 2013 a risk assessment by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Sequences of CRESS DNA viruses previously reported in humans (TN9, TN12, and TN25), and detected in different animal species (e.g., birds, dogs, and bats) were herein detected in fecal samples of synanthropic squamates (geckos and lizards). The complete genome sequence of six viruses was generated. This study extends the information on the genetic diversity and ecology of CRESS DNA viruses. Because geckos and lizards are synanthropic animals, a role in sustaining CRESS DNA virus circulation and increasing viral pressure in the environment is postulated."
Effects of anthropogenic noise on anuran amphibians,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28c2c5640516c054a00a8337a73ee10c99658fd0,Valentina Zaffaroni-Caorsi; C. Both; R. Márquez; Diego Llusia; P. Narins; Marina Debon; Márcio Borges‐Martins,"ABSTRACT Anthropogenic noise is widespread in nature and has been shown to produce a plethora of impacts on wildlife. Sounds play a fundamental role in the lives of amphibians, with species relying on acoustic communication for social and reproductive behaviour, and thus noise can potentially interfere with these activities. Here, we provide a literature review on the effects of anthropogenic noise on anuran amphibians, based on 32 studies (63 species from 14 families) that document noise-driven changes in species behaviour, physiology and ecology caused by urbanisation, transportation and energy production. Experimental and observational studies found evidence that both airborne and seismic anthropogenic noise influence anuran calling activity, with consequences in mate selection, and induce physiological changes including increased stress, suppressed immune function and colouration changes. Negative noise effects in species abundance and attendance over the reproductive season were reported. Even though adaptations and behavioural adjustments enable species to respond to these noises, it is yet to be understood whether these changes alleviate the negative impacts. Furthermore, collaborative efforts between scientists, stakeholders and private/public institutions are imperative to create conservation guidelines and legal instruments to be implemented during urban expansion projects and mitigate the effects of noise pollution on amphibian anurans."
"What is a river? A transnational meditation on the colonial city, abolition ecologies and the future of geography",2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28c4f5caf6fd0401cdfb47c15198be223121857d,Wangui Kimari; J. Parish,"ABSTRACT This short essay, flowing through Nairobi and Toronto, represents a transnational conversation on what the contemporary status of urban rivers can tell us about the endurance of coloniality in these two spaces. Against the hegemonic bids for their “revitalization,” we attend to these two rivers, both of which helped propel the growth of their respective urban agglomerations, as symbols of people-centered struggles for abolition ecologies. We aim to provoke the incorporation of more plural understandings and narrations within the discipline of geography, and have been struck by the similarities across different post- and settler-colonial contexts, and, as well, the limited lenses that attend to these environments in academic scholarship. Accordingly, we also highlight the possibilities that emerge in thinking jointly with urban spaces across the “North” and “South” divide, in order to demonstrate the connected and pervasive nature of empire, and the variegated practices that resist coloniality in cities."
Physiological and morphological correlates of blood parasite infection in urban and non-urban house sparrow populations,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28c720adcadc3233ab0b5174ae906b52c6e2c83d,Coraline Bichet; F. Brischoux; C. Ribout; C. Parenteau; Alizée Meillère; F. Angelier,"In the last decade, house sparrow populations have shown a general decline, especially in cities. Avian malaria has been recently suggested as one of the potential causes of this decline, and its detrimental effects could be exacerbated in urban habitats. It was initially thought that avian malaria parasites would not have large negative effects on wild birds because of their long co-evolution with their hosts. However, it is now well-documented that they can have detrimental effects at both the primo- and chronical infection stages. In this study, we examined avian malaria infection and its physiological and morphological consequences in four populations of wild house sparrows (2 urban and 2 rural). We did not find any relationship between the proportions of infected individuals and the urbanisation score calculated for our populations. However, we observed that the proportion of infected individuals increased during the course of the season, and that juveniles were less infected than adults. We did not detect a strong effect of malaria infection on physiological, morphological and condition indexes. Complex parasite dynamics and the presence of confounding factors could have masked the potential effects of infection. Thus, longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to understand the evolutionary ecology of this very common, but still poorly understood, wild bird parasite."

Focusing on the molecular transformations of sand–from silt to concrete to rubble–the first half of this paper studies the geosocial history of Dubai over the course of the twentieth century, including the dredging of Dubai Creek, the making of Jebel Ali Port, and the construction of the World Islands. I draw on reports, archival records, and newspapers, as well as existing scholarship, to demonstrate the infrastructural exuberance of Dubai, its tendency to marshal vast amounts of sand in the construction of increasingly outrageous infrastructures. In the second half of the paper, I follow some of the threads that emerge from this site in a more theoretical and comparative register. I draw comparisons between Dubai and similar world–cities in the global South, to understand and critique how this infrastructural exuberance exists alongside increasing concerns over ‘sand scarcity'. Drawing on the work of Georges Bataille (1991. The accursed share: volume 1: consumption, tr. by Hurley, R. New York: Zone Books), Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari (1983. Anti–oedipus: capitalism and schizophrenia, tr. by Hurley, R. New York, NY: Penguin Classics; 1987. A thousand plateaus: capitalism and schizophrenia, tr. by Massumi, B. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press), and McKenzie Wark (2015. Molecular red: theory for the anthropocene. New York: Verso), I develop a framework of antiproductive ecologies that treats incommensurable forms of surplus and waste (such as sand and rubble) as constitutive of world–cities. Developing Deleuze and Guattari's concept of ‘antiproduction’ from an environmental perspective, I argue that in their exuberance and thirst for construction, world–cities like Dubai attempt to organize and render productive the very planetary distribution of sand and silt."
The relational shift in urban ecology: From place and structures to multiple modes of coproduction for positive urban futures,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28f7884381cd960b1d522f61a1c2ff37e66d7836,Steward T A Pickett; AbdouMaliq T Simone; Pippin Anderson; Ayyoob Sharifi; Aliyu Salisu Barau; Fushcia-Ann Hoover; Daniel L.

Muñoz-Erickson; Chantal Pacteau; Morgan Grove; Niki Frantzeskaki; Harini Nagendra; Joshua Ginsberg,"This perspective emerged from ongoing dialogue among ecologists initiated by a virtual workshop in 2021. A transdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners conclude that urban ecology as a science can better contribute to positive futures by focusing on relationships, rather than prioritizing urban structures. Insights from other relational disciplines, such as political ecology, governance, urban design, and conservation also contribute. Relationality is especially powerful given the need to rapidly adapt to the changing social and biophysical drivers of global urban systems. These unprecedented dynamics are better understood through a relational lens than traditional structural questions. We use three kinds of coproduction—of the social-ecological world, of science, and of actionable knowledge—to identify key processes of coproduction within urban places. Connectivity is crucial to relational urban ecology. Eight themes emerge from the joint explorations of the paper and point toward social action for improving life and environment in urban futures."
An Updated Systematic Review of Risk and Protective Factors Related to the Resilience and Well-Being of Indigenous Youth in the United States and Canada.,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/290543a46949edb0a6d283b514fd2373e9f8e3ad,C. Hodgson; Rhea N DeCoteau; Joshuaa D Allison-Burbank; Timian M Godfrey,"Indigenous youth in North America experience mental health inequities compared to White peers, including a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety, suicide, and substance use. This systematic review of culturally specific risk and protective factors related to resilience and mental health in Indigenous youth aimed to synthesize the recent evidence and update a systematic review of evidence prior to 2013 (Burnette and Figley, 2016). Following PRISMA guidelines, seven academic databases were searched for peer-reviewed qualitative and quantitative resilience research with Indigenous youth (age 19 and under) in the United States and Canada published from 2014 to 2021. Seventy-eight studies met inclusion criteria and provided ample knowledge about risk and protective factors for the resilience of Indigenous youth across the Social Ecology of Resilience theory: individual (86%), family (53%), community (60%), cultural (50%), and societal (19%). A plethora of recent interventions serve as examples of context and culture-specific responses to the mental health needs of Indigenous youth. Further attention to younger children, urban populations, and Indigenous knowledge systems is needed. In particular, the influence of racism, settler colonialism, and cultural resurgence efforts on the well-being of Indigenous youth are areas for future research."
AGENCY AND POWER OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES: Assembling Micro Infrastructures as Everyday Resistance and Resilience in North Jakarta's Port,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2908182eb4b5fda105d06aedead33153120c56a4,Naimah Lutfi Abdullah Talib,"The rise of the global supply chain has intensified the circulation of goods and capital across the world. While the body of literature on the politics and political‐economy aspects of logistical expansion has grown, little attention has been given to understanding how coastal fishers’ communities interact with the ongoing development of mega infrastructure. I argue that it is essential to place spatial and temporal specificity at the centre of analysis to further understanding of everyday resistance and resilience. In this article, I use a case study of the Port development in Jakarta to argue that renegotiating and reworking space and place amid the development of the mega port is a form of nonviolent everyday resistance and resilience that operates under, but also against, the capitalist political‐economy configuration. I focus on everyday resistance, particularly Asef Bayat's concept of quiet encroachment, and resilience literature to demonstrate the development and contested usage of micro and temporary infrastructures, both at household and community levels, as a material example of how diverse groups in communities exercise their agency and power, and express everyday resistance and resilience differently. Through this article, I aim to contribute to the broader literature on a situated political urban ecology, particularly on everyday resistance and resilience in postcolonial urbanism."
The Study on Landscape Regeneration Design of Xuzhou Mining Wastelands Under the Background of Sustainable Development,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2908dd957fc01de5278463cf1e60cca718c51688,Hongtao Xing; Pisit Puntien,"Objective: This study explores the application of sustainable development principles in the landscape regeneration design of mining wastelands in Xuzhou, aiming to analyze their ecological value and development significance, while evaluating innovative designs to provide important references for regional ecological governance and urban renewal.
 
Theoretical Framework: This study uses the abandoned quarry at Anran Mountain in Xuzhou as a case study, applying the frameworks of sustainable development theory, ecological restoration theory, and low-impact landscape development theory. By integrating these three theories, the aim is to propose a landscape regeneration design model for mining wastelands with ecological, social, and cultural value, promoting sustainable regional development.
 
Methodology: The study employs a mixed-method approach, with a focus on qualitative analysis. Through surveys, expert interviews, data collection, field research, and case studies, the research comprehensively assesses the development history of mining wastelands in China, sustainable development principles, and site development strategies.
 
Results and Discussion: The results show that the landscape development of mining wastelands has gone through three stages: ""environmental restoration—reuse—diversified development,"" reflecting a shift from single ecological governance to broader social and cultural objectives. The application of sustainable development principles, particularly low-impact development, the use of natural materials, and the recycling of waste, highlights the importance of designing according to site characteristics, minimizing external interference, and fostering synergy between ecological protection and economic benefits. The study proposes strategies for plant community restoration, water resource utilization, and the redesign of waste materials, considering the site's specific conditions and incorporating both ecological functionality and local characteristics in the design. Additionally, the incorporation of wetland landscape design and ecological education functions not only restores the ecological environment but also provides recreational and educational spaces, enhancing public environmental awareness.
 
Research Implications: This study proposes a sustainable development path for the regeneration of mining wastelands, integrating ecology, functionality, and aesthetics. It recommends low-impact development strategies, utilizing local materials and native plants to promote ecological restoration and natural aesthetics. Transforming mining wastelands into sustainable parks enhances urban ecosystem services and aligns with the goals of green city development.
 
Value: This research explores a relatively under-researched area in the context of Xuzhou, contributing to the sustainable development of the local environment."

Consequently, sustainability and resilience have become key elements in better response to the crisis and maintaining an equilibrium between ecology, economics, and various social domains. The design and use of urban land should consider including a multi-functional green infrastructure to obtain different benefits, from ecosystem services to value creation. Additionally, the urban land-use planning system contributes to economic growth, social development and environmental sustainability, while biodiversity can provide renewal and reorganization capacities for changes in the social-ecosystems. All these elements bring forth a different paradigm for the future decisions of communities. Paper seeks to synthesize Keywords: Resilience, sustainability, urban land use."
"The city as forest - integrating living infrastructure, climate conditioning and urban forestry in Canberra, Australia",2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/297d7e323d6b5ed81d8b6389b043339c68d4f871,J. Alexandra; B. Norman,"Background Around the world cities are responding to environmental imperatives, including climate change, with diverse programs of ecologically inspired design, water re-engineering, habitat restoration and urban reafforestation. These are collectively known as living infrastructure. This paper is based on a review undertaken to identify suitable options for the use of living infrastructure in Australia’s capital city, Canberra. Known as the ‘bush’ capital, Canberra is a medium sized city ringed with forested hills and grassy woodlands and has one of the highest rates of planted trees in the world, on a per capita basis. This paper summarises the lessons from investigating the opportunities for urban forests, and other living infrastructure being used to further enhance Canberra’s amenity and climate adaptation strategies. Results Canberra is a planned city with a history of afforestation since its inception, but still has many opportunities to build on its status as an urban forest. Trees offer more than a backdrop to the city housing Australia’s parliamentary democracy and national cultural institutions – they form a key part of the city’s infrastructure. Planted forests, surrounding bushland and constructed lakes have cultural, practical and ecological values and provide multiple benefits, including climate conditioning. However, they face a range of pressures including from urban redevelopment and a changing climate, raising questions about how to sustain and enhance Canberra’s living infrastructure, whilst meeting other urban policy goals. Using the case of Canberra, this paper outlines how living infrastructure – including urban forests - can contribute to meeting the twenty-first century’s urban challenges. Conclusions The experience in Canberra demonstrate that investing in active programs of urban reafforestation and more water sensitive design provide significant opportunities to enhance cities, making them both more liveable and climate responsive. For this to occur at scale, integrated planning is needed that brings together the physical, social and ecological elements of urban systems, including through the integration of different theoretical and practical traditions including from urban planning, energy, transport and water engineering and conservation ecology. At a broader level, this involves reconceptualising the nature of the city and its socio-ecological relationships."
"Parental care, allomothering and child health in north-western Tanzania : who cares for children and does it matter?",2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/299b7880ec435133385f89682398fb2d18466a6b,A. Hassan,"Human children are unique among primates for the amount and duration of care and provisioning they require from adults during infancy. Studies in anthropology, demography and human behavioural ecology show considerable flexibility across human societies in who provides this care, and a wide variation in how it impacts child wellbeing. However, there is still relatively little research that determines which factors predict who provides this help. Studies exploring allomaternal support in detail tend to have small sample sizes, whereas large-scale studies have used proxy measures for allomaternal care (e.g., absence/presence of kin). Such dichotomous indicators may mask variation in children’s caregiving environments, and thus in the relationship between children’s care and health. This thesis has three main aims: (1) to draw on the methodological strengths of anthropological and demographic research on childcare to collect data that overcomes previous limitations; (2) to contribute to a more thorough and interdisciplinary understanding of the patterns and predictors of childcare; and (3) to shed light on potential demographic and health implications of childcare. These aims are addressed in three research chapters, using detailed data collected on parental and alloparental childcare from 808 children aged under 5-years, in two diverse communities in north-western Tanzania representative of on-going demographic and urban transitions. This research confirms that children receive many different types of care from a variety of individuals, including parents, siblings, various relatives and non-kin. Who cares for children is determined by factors including the child’s sex, parental co-residence, and the community’s level of market integration; with suggestions of responsive childcare systems. However, relationships between allomaternal care and children’s health are inconsistent, implying complexity in children’s caregiving environments. This research also highlights the value of understanding how allomaternal behaviour changes with market integration, shedding light on contemporary demographic and health transitions."
Why Urban Ecology Matters in Ethiopia,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/299ce1b4051ae782c7d9d4f5b5ca9f29da35d93a,G. Perry; Fikirte Gebresenbet; Michelle M. DaPra; P. Branco; Wondmagegne Whibesilassie; M. Jelacic; Abel Estifanos Eyob,"Three concurrent global environmental trends are particularly apparent: human population growth, urbanization, and climate change. Especially in countries such as Ethiopia in the Global South, all three are impacted by, and in turn have bearing upon, social justice and equity. Combined, these spatial and social factors reduce wellbeing, leading to increasing urgency to create urban environments that are more livable, resilient, and adaptive. However, the impacts on, and of, non-human urban residents, particularly on the ecosystem services they provide, are often neglected. We review the literature using the One Health theoretical framework and focusing on Ethiopia as a case-study. We argue for specific urban strategies that benefit humans and also have spillover effects that benefit other species, and vice versa. For example, urban trees provide shade, clean the air, help combat climate change, create more livable neighborhoods, and offer habitat for many species. Similarly, urban neighborhoods that attract wildlife have characteristics that also make them more desirable for humans, resulting in improved health outcomes, higher livability, and enhanced real-estate values. After summarizing the present state of knowledge about urban ecology, we emphasize components relevant to the developing world in general and pre- COVID-19 pandemic Ethiopia in particular, then expand the discussion to include social justice and equity concerns in the built environment. Prior to the ongoing civil war, Ethiopia was beginning to invest in more sustainable urbanization and serve as a model. Especially in light of the conflict and pandemic, much more will need to be done."
Regional Environmental Management and Planning Leading to Sustainable Development,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29a02fec887d383046819a2f2a040f8ef806a669,Gunjan Pandey,"Environmental Management plays a significant role for not just India but for the whole world to resolve environmental problems. We have to plan the use of our natural resources in a very judicious manner. True development oriented planning helps to always bring about a balance between economic growth and development on one side and environmental conservation and preservation of natural resources on the other. It is only then sustainable development can be brought about in a country and the world as a whole India cannot become a developed country, if it chooses to ignore the need for environmental planning and management. This would avoid overuse and misuse of the natural resources of the country. It also minimizes the impact of human activities on ecology. This paper discusses the environmental problems faced by the rural and urban areas and also as to how they can be tackled with proper Environmental planning and management of these regions. This paper is divided into five sections besides introduction. Section II informs about the environmental problems faced by the rural areas. Section III deals with the environmental impact on the urban areas. Section IV highlights the government and other organizational efforts being made to tackle the environmental hazards faced by the rural poor and also the policy suggestions. Section V brings forth the planning and management efforts made by the government and others non­governmental agencies to eradicate the environmental adverse Implications on the urban poor. Lastly, Section VI on conclusion brings out the summary and findings of the paper."

Contrast in daily activity patterns of red squirrels inhabiting urban park and urban forest,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29c249155700c4fb74d7b9b18d51af1385469e77,Agata Beliniak; Krauze-Gryz Dagny; K. Jasińska; Karolina Jankowska; J. Gryz,"The Eurasian red squirrel is one of the species that has well adapted to urban habitats and is habitu- ated to human presence. Its urban populations diﬀer from those in rural habitats in terms of e.g. abundance, spatial organisation and behaviour. Food availability aﬀects the ecology of red squir- rels, so in this study we hypothesise that in the urban park with supplemental food, red squirrels will alter their activity rhythms to beneﬁt from human presence. We therefore compared seasonal changes in the daily activity patterns of two red squirrel populations, inhabiting two diﬀerent areas in Warsaw: a busy urban park (with plentiful supplemental feeding) and an urban forest reserve (closed for public). Between September 2018 and July 2019 we used camera traps to monitor red squirrels activity round-the-clock. In the park (contrarily to the forest), the number of records of red squirrels per 100 trap days was lowest in summer and highest in winter. Probably squirrels in the urban park, were able to maintain high activity during winter thanks to all-year-round availab- ility of supplementary food. Daily activity patterns diﬀered seasonally and between the study sites. In the forest they resembled those recorded in natural habitats, i.e. two activity peaks, one after the sunrise and second before the sunset. In contrast, park squirrels showed mostly one activity peak, beginning some hours after the sunrise and lasting until noon/early afternoon (depending on the season). Park squirrels were almost exclusively day-active, while forest squirrels were also recorded before sunrise and after sunset. We suggest that park squirrels shifted their activity to times with higher visitor frequency, which, assumingly, increased chances to obtain supplemental food."
Designing co-living housing with green and ecology architecture concept,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29c9e679fd5b081d6d369ebd249c611a9af05bd1,D.

This study aims to examine a project of a co-living boarding house in sub-urban area of jakarta based on ecological and green architecture principle theories by Sim Van Der Ryn and Stuart Cowan as well as Robert and Brenda Vale. Both principles were used to identify the ecological and green design parameters to test the boarding house. Results of the study revealed that there are 4 parameters of ecological-green architecture design, such as nature should be the main actor of the design; nature becomes a solution for every problem in the site; honor the user by involved them as a designer; and be a climate conscious building by conserving energy. From the examination conducted, it is also revealed that the boarding house qualified as an ecologic and green architecture design."
How Does a Common Fruit Bat Respond to Habitat and Environmental Variables Within an Isolated Green Zone of an African Urban Landscape?,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29cfcd59eda336f4fc7ce5e5b0d837be53c95bbb,Michael Adjei Ayeh; K. Amponsah‐Mensah; L. H. Holbech,"Given the high rate at which urban landscapes across Africa expand, continuous monitoring of adaptations and responses to ongoing habitat changes is a prerequisite for effective conservation management of key ecosystem components, hereunder important seed dispersers such as fruit bats. We used the widespread and habitat generalist Gambian Epauletted Fruit Bat Epomophorus gambianus as an ecological model species and tested whether environmental variables linked to urbanisation were related to aspects of their roost and foraging behavioural ecology. Within an isolated green zone (the University of Ghana campus), situated in the otherwise heavily urbanised Accra, Ghana, a prime focus was assessing the relationship between habitat and environmental features as against roost and foraging behavioural ecology. We radio‐tagged and tracked a total of 11 bats, thereby detecting 22 roosts and 16 foraging trees, in which repeated bat counts, as well as environmental variables, were recorded during 3–4 months in 2022. We show that E. gambianus preferred older, large, shady exotic teak, mango, and the West African legume Millettia thonningii as roost trees, whereas Coastal golden‐leaf fruit Bridelia micrantha and mangoes were preferred for foraging. Female roost fidelity was relatively high, with females using fewer trees more evenly than males, indicating sexual dimorphism related to larger roost and foraging ranges, higher territoriality, and more opportunistic male reproductive traits."

Fournet,"Although the urban areas of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire have faced recurrent outbreaks of Aedes-borne arboviruses, the seasonal dynamics of local populations of the key vector Aedes aegypti remained still underexplored for an effective vector control. The current study thus assessed the seasonal dynamics and the spatial distribution of Ae. aegypti in three neighborhoods of Abidjan city. Aedes eggs were collected using ovitraps in three different neighborhoods (Anoumambo, Bromakoté, and Petit-Bassam) during the four climatic seasons of Abidjan. Aedes egg samples were immersed into distilled water, and emerged larvae were reared until the adult stage for species morphological identification. Spatial autocorrelation was measured with the Moran's Index, and areas with high egg abundance were identified. In total, 3837 eggs were collected providing 1882 adult mosquitoes in the 3 neighborhoods. All the specimens belonged to only one Aedes species, Ae. aegypti. The average of 15.89 eggs per ovitrap, 13.67 eggs per ovitrap, and 19.87 eggs per ovitrap were obtained in Anoumambo, Bromakoté, and Petit-Bassam, respectively, with no statistical difference between the three sites. A higher abundance of Ae. aegypti was observed during the long rainy season and the short dry season. The Moran analysis showed a clustered distribution of Ae. aegypti eggs during the long rainy season in the three sites and a random spatial distribution during the short dry season. Ovitraps with high number of eggs were aggregated in the peripheral part (near to the lagoon) of Anoumambo and Petit-Bassam in central Bromakoté and extending along the railway during the long rainy season. This study revealed a heterogeneous potential risk of transmission of arbovirus according to neighborhood. It provided data to better understand Ae. aegypti ecology to select appropriate periods and places for Aedes vector control actions and surveillance of arboviruses in Abidjan."
Book Review: Promises of the Political: Insurgent Cities in a Post-Political Environment,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29d7c9294f50c8d4826eed3863cda818679348c4,Uma Dey Sarkar,"Eric Swyngedouw’s book, Promises of the Political: Insurgent Cities in a PostPolitical Environment, begins with economic and ecological events which have made headlines in the last 5 years and the many violent protests on city streets which give him hope. Promises of the Political is the logical outcome of the author’s decadelong engagement with issues in urban political ecology and the necessity for better understanding the city as a site of emancipatory political praxis. While Swyngedouw has explored the themes in the book in several previously published articles (Swyngedouw, 2005, 2009, 2010; Wilson and Swyngedouw, 2014), they have been rewritten to present a cogent argument put forth within the postfoundational approach.1 The author’s twofold aim in the book is to understand processes of postpoliticization and postdemocratization using nature, climate change and urbanization as analytical categories and the possibility of thinking and practicing emancipatory politics in this postpolitical world. The book is organized into three wellresearched sections with each section clearly defining and building on the arguments presented earlier."
Alternate: Jane Jacobs’ legacy,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29f265f7de967bf48b740d91d5fd296c2fd605bb,P. Taylor; G. O’Brien; P. O'keefe,"This chapter provides a description of Jane Jacobs’ legacy beyond her famous intervention into city planning. Five aspects of her work are highlighted. First and foremost she was a knowledge builder, harnessing a voracious curiosity to understand the complexity of the human condition. The most auspicious outcome has been her revision of economics identifying city economies as the loci of economic growth. She made further unusual forays into history – contesting power to eliminate complexity – and politics where her bottom-up approach had drawn admiration from both the right and left. She brought this altogether towards the end of her life as a new understanding of economics as ecology. The chapter concludes with a critical appraisal of her treatment of urban demand – crucial to the argument of this book – and links Jacob’s oeuvre to the work of multiple other radical scholars to aid the process of unthinking."
Singapore’s 5 decades of dengue prevention and control—Implications for global dengue control,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29ff4142cfa05a00ec64e83f1ef36f835aeb93b4,S. Ho; Jue Tao Lim; Janet Ong; H. Hapuarachchi; S. Sim; L. Ng,"This paper summarises the lessons learnt in dengue epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention in Singapore over the last half a century, during which Singapore evolved from a city of 1.9 million people to a highly urban globalised city-state with a population of 5.6 million. Set in a tropical climate, urbanisation among green foliage has created ideal conditions for the proliferation of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, the mosquito vectors that transmit dengue. A vector control programme, largely for malaria, was initiated as early as 1921, but it was only in 1966 that the Vector Control Unit (VCU) was established to additionally tackle dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) that was first documented in the 1960s. Centred on source reduction and public education, and based on research into the bionomics and ecology of the vectors, the programme successfully reduced the Aedes House Index (HI) from 48% in 1966 to <5% in the 1970s. Further enhancement of the programme, including through legislation, suppressed the Aedes HI to around 1% from the 1990s. The current programme is characterised by 4 key features: (i) proactive inter-epidemic surveillance and control that is stepped up during outbreaks; (ii) risk-based prevention and intervention strategies based on advanced data analytics; (iii) coordinated inter-sectoral cooperation between the public, private, and people sectors; and (iv) evidence-based adoption of new tools and strategies. Dengue seroprevalence and force of infection (FOI) among residents have substantially and continuously declined over the 5 decades. This is consistent with the observation that dengue incidence has been delayed to adulthood, with severity highest among the elderly. Paradoxically, the number of reported dengue cases and outbreaks has increased since the 1990s with record-breaking epidemics. We propose that Singapore’s increased vulnerability to outbreaks is due to low levels of immunity in the population, constant introduction of new viral variants, expanding urban centres, and increasing human density. The growing magnitude of reported outbreaks could also be attributed to improved diagnostics and surveillance, which at least partially explains the discord between rising trend in cases and the continuous reduction in dengue seroprevalence. Changing global and local landscapes, including climate change, increasing urbanisation and global physical connectivity are expected to make dengue control even more challenging. The adoption of new vector surveillance and control tools, such as the Gravitrap and Wolbachia technology, is important to impede the growing threat of dengue and other Aedes-borne diseases."
DNA metabarcoding reveals that coyotes in New York City consume wide variety of native prey species and human food,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a279a0f52776d2dba91ecf19a5a2ab4c670aedc,Carol S. Henger; Emily Hargous; Christopher M. Nagy; M. Weckel; Claudia Wultsch; Konstantinos Krampis; N. Duncan; L. Gormezano; J. Munshi-South,"Carnivores are currently colonizing cities where they were previously absent. These urban environments are novel ecosystems characterized by habitat degradation and fragmentation, availability of human food, and different prey assemblages than surrounding areas. Coyotes (Canis latrans) established a breeding population in New York City (NYC) over the last few decades, but their ecology within NYC is poorly understood. In this study, we used non-invasive scat sampling and DNA metabarcoding to profile vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant dietary items with the goal to compare the diets of urban coyotes to those inhabiting non-urban areas. We found that both urban and non-urban coyotes consumed a variety of plants and animals as well as human food. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) were an important food item for coyotes within and outside NYC. In contrast, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were mainly eaten by coyotes inhabiting non-urban areas. Domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) was the human food item found in most scats from both urban and non-urban coyotes. Domestic cats (Felis catus) were consumed by urban coyotes but were detected in only a small proportion of the scats (<5%), which differs markedly from high rates of cat depredation in some other cities. In addition, we compared our genetic metabarcoding analysis to a morphological analysis of the same scat samples. We found that the detection similarity between the two methods was low and it varied depending on the type of diet item."
Loving and Healing a Hurt City: Planning a Green Monterrey Metropolitan Area,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a2d866b46f823975245436192b74cc2163b3f56,Rob Roggema; Igor Ishi Rubio Cisneros; Rodrigo Junco López; Paulina Ramirez Leal; Marina Ramirez Suarez; Miguel Ortiz Díaz,"In many conurbations, the pressure on the quality of living increases and affects the most vulnerable human and non-human populations the most. This article describes a proposal for the mapping and design investigation of how a green metropolis can be developed. The approach distinguishes between the landscape producing pain, the ways of healing, and the opportunities to create environments that people can love. This approach reveals concrete and widespread pain in the metropolis, such as impacts on natural landscapes (rivers and mountains), air pollution, ecological degradation, and hydrological disconnections. The strategy to remediate this pain is to uncover hidden and altered creeks and rivers, creating an abundant zone of ecological space around them before human activities and urbanization change the land uses. In addition to this, specific design principles have been developed for hydro-ecological corridors, water retention, green islands, and greenways. Designs for these places can be replicated to support a healing strategy in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA). Each place creates an environment that the urban residents will appreciate and preserve. The approach to analyzing landscape pain, designing healing strategies, and promoting local places of love can be applied to enhance the quality of life for many urban residents and non-human ecologies in metropolitan areas around the globe."

Water quality assessment in mosquito breeding habitats based on dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll measurements by laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a588166f00bf39e731734535bd7702c909d5e20,A. Huzortey; A. Kudom; B. A. Mensah; B. Sefa-Ntiri; B. Anderson; A. Akyea,"Rapid urbanization and its associated pollution can affect water quality in mosquito breeding habitats and, as a result, the ecology and control of mosquito vectors. To understand the effects of pollution on mosquito vectors, an accurate assessment of water quality in breeding habitats is needed. Presently, water quality assessment of mosquito breeding habitats is usually based on the measurement of individual physicochemical parameters. However, several parameters are sometimes difficult to interpret or may not give a clear picture of the overall water quality of the breeding habitats, especially when the pollutants are in complex mixtures. This study employed the use of Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy to assess water quality in breeding habitats of Anopheles, Aedes, and Culex mosquitoes in urban areas in Cape Coast, Ghana. The LIF spectra, using a 445-nm diode laser, were measured from field-collected water samples in the laboratory. The LIF spectra showed the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and chlorophyll in the breeding habitats. The DOM and chlorophyll fluorescence signals were normalised by the Raman vibrational signals to determine water quality in each habitat. The overall water quality was better in Aedes breeding habitats than in Anopheles and Culex breeding habitats. The poor water quality in Anopheles and Culex breeding habitats was due to the presence of high fulvic acid and chlorophyll content, which often reflect pollutants from anthropogenic sources. Anopheles and Aedes habitats were made up of mainly An. coluzzii and Ae. aegypti respectively while Culex species were identified to genus level. The results add up to the growing concern about the breeding of Anopheles in polluted habitats. The study demonstrated for the first time the ability of LIF spectroscopy to assess water quality in mosquito breeding habitats."

Craft,"Urban expansion can fundamentally alter wildlife movement and gene flow, but how urbanization alters pathogen spread is poorly understood. Here, we combine high resolution host and viral genomic data with landscape variables to examine the context of viral spread in puma (Puma concolor) from two contrasting regions: one bounded by the wildland urban interface (WUI) and one unbounded with minimal anthropogenic development (UB). We found landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) spread in the WUI, but not in the unbounded region. The most important predictors of viral spread also differed; host spatial proximity, host relatedness, and mountain ranges played a role in FIV spread in the WUI, whereas roads might have facilitated viral spread in the unbounded region. Our research demonstrates how anthropogenic landscapes can alter pathogen spread, providing a more nuanced understanding of host-pathogen relationships to inform disease ecology in free-ranging species. Nick Fountain-Jones et al. use genomic and spatial data to examine how urbanization affects the spread of the pathogen feline immunodeficiency virus in pumas from areas of varying anthropogenic development. Their results show that landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation in virus spread in a region bounded by urban development but did not in a more wild landscape, demonstrating how anthropogenic landscapes can alter pathogen spread."
Substance (mis)use among refugees as a matter of social ecology: insights into a multi-site rapid assessment in Germany,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a632a3f7816d29414716e10f946abbc040286dc,Laura Hertner; Panagiotis Stylianopoulos; A. Heinz; U. Kluge; I. Schäfer; S. Penka,"Background Previous research concluded that substance (mis)use is increasing among forcibly displaced populations. Nevertheless, little research has been conducted within a social ecological framework aimed at identifying and understanding the factors affecting substance (mis)use embedded in the post-migration context in high-income countries. The present study aims to develop an understanding of the links and underlying mechanisms between refugees’ social ecological determinants and substance (mis)using behavior. Methods Rapid assessments (RAs), including 108 semi-structured interviews and 10 focus group discussions with key persons from various professional, and personal backgrounds, were carried out in German urban and rural areas. The RA approach of interviewing key persons and not solely refugees that (mis)use substances allowed us to gather multi-perspective knowledge on this sensitive topic. Qualitative content analysis was applied, aiming at identifying determinants of substance (mis)use embedded in the post-migration context of refugees and understanding the underlying mechanisms. Results One main result of the data suggests that the link between refugees’ countries of origin and their post-migration substance (mis)use is not as direct as often assumed. It is observed that refugees’ prospects and opportunities in receiving countries (e.g., work permits) undermine this commonly reproduced link. Further determinants are related to living conditions in German refugee shelters and social relations with peers and families. The influence of refugees’ living conditions can be summarized as potentially increasing substance availability and distress, whereas family separation produces a loss of control and responsibility, increasing the risk for substance (mis)use. Peers’ influence on substance (mis)use was reported to reflect a search for a sense of belonging. Conclusions Given that refugees who (mis)use substances have limited to no control over the factors identified in our study to be associated with substance (mis)use, common treatment and prevention approaches are challenged. Furthermore, we recommend aiming for a holistic comprehension of refugees’ substance (mis)use by expanding the focus beyond individuals to the social ecological context in any attempt, including prevention, treatment, research, and policy."

The city of Kirov, Russia, was taken as a sample for the study, which went on from 2012 through 2018. The analysis demonstrated practically no statistically significant correlations in the dynamics of indices of individual subgroups of indicators, as well as in the dynamics of indices of individual indicators, although with a few exceptions. The results of the study confirm the need to improve the methodology of calculating the integral indices of cities and regions. These indices are related to urban ecology, quality of life, and sustainable development issues. The results also demonstrated the inadequacy of such tools for systematic and comprehensive international analysis of today urbanization problems."

Pasquero,"To reflect today, as designers and researchers, on the issue of Second Life, is to pose questions not only about the potential contemporary articulations of the term within a disciplinary field defined by knowledge that intertwines sectors like Urbanism, Architecture, Interior Design and Design but also to explore the very concept of life rendering living organisms – both human and not – as an active part of the speculation and the eventual experimentations giving new meaning to actions like regeneration or reuse. To do so, it is necessary to amplify the range of intervention and to engage other disciplines like biology and computer science, but also philosophy, anthropology and many more. An example of this practice is systemic design, a method defined by the combination and integration of systemic thought, computational design, biotechnology and prototyping. It is an extended approach to design – ranging from the micro to macro – incorporated in applications where projects and installations become interactive laboratories based on interspecies collaboration. A testament to this approach is the work carried out by a multidisciplinary entity like ecoLogicStudio, through theory and practice."

Rethinking the Ecology of Towns and Villages,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ab070ad3af44dd225d2374e17418277d9765100,Ezequiel González,"Towns, Ecology, and the Land. Forman, R.T.T. 2019. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K. xviii+ 585 pp. £39.99 (paperback). ISBN 978-1-316-64860-5. In its beginnings, ecology as a discipline focused mainly on the study of natural, pristine environments to understand their structure and functioning. Later on, as human impacts on the planet became more evident, the interest in anthropogenic habitats, such as agricultural landscapes or urbanized areas increased. Nevertheless, there seems to be a meeting point where natural habitats interact with productive areas and human settlements: the land of towns and villages. Despite that the land belonging to towns and villages covers an impressive half of Earth’s surface (Hoekstra et al. 2010), they have been poorly investigated, as Richard Forman describes in Towns, Ecology, and the Land. The author, a Harvard University emeritus professor, is well recognized for his contributions to landscape, road, and urban ecology. He admits that only recently did he start to consider towns as more than places to eat or get fuel during fieldwork. Villages and towns can go from a few dozen to 30,000 people, but altogether their inhabitants make up almost half the world’s population. Moreover, towns provide resources for large cities, so we all depend on towns in the end. When considering these facts, it is surprising that very little attention has been paid to their ecology. In this book, the author aims to describe and summarize what is known about towns and their interactions with their surroundings from several perspectives. Furthermore, he proposes that town ecology can help to improve towns and perhaps even to stop their globally observable shrinkage. The book is divided into 4 parts and starts with a description of the anatomy of towns and villages. Villages and towns differ in their population size, villages (200– 2,000 residents) are much smaller and have a simpler structure than towns (2,000–30,000 residents). Towns have common elements, such as a central plaza, a town center, and older and newer residential areas. But they are also quite variable by their shape, location, and main economic activity or key resources. Other critical definitions that are used throughout the text are included in the first part, such as town edge, adjacent zone, and surrounding land. The adjacent zone is located immediately beyond the edge and is highly relevant because the flows that come in and out from towns are most intense there. The surrounding land is the outer area of influence of a town, and it can be dominated by farmland or natural areas. The first part of the book also covers the temporal changes experienced by townspeople and the social dimensions of living and working in towns. After all, many people, including myself, have chosen to live in towns. The second part deals with the ecological dimensions of towns, from the soil, air, and water to plants and animals. Both soil and air in towns differ from natural, cultivated, and highly urbanized conditions. Moreover, soil and water are key resources that determine the location of a town, and specific chapters are dedicated to describing their relevance. Despite being smaller than cities, towns have to deal with pollution, particularly when industries are present, and this topic is also addressed in this section. Town flora and fauna are usually diverse and are particularly influenced by a “species rain” from the surroundings. A community of resident plants and animals is typically present in towns, and their ecology is described in detail. Not only wildlife, but also town residents, value green spaces in towns and in surrounding areas due to the different ecosystem services they provide. The interaction between towns and land is discussed by differentiating the urbanized, agricultural, and natural components. The description of 3 major parts of towns—commercial, industrial, and residential—is quite long and makes several connections with previous parts of the book. The links between towns and farmland take place in the adjacent zone and the surrounding land and are described using concepts and examples from landscape ecology and movement ecology. The directional effects of natural land on towns and vice versa are demonstrated when these are forests or deserts. A chapter attempts to link all these components more explicitly based on corridor-ecology concepts that explain flows of energy and organisms. The last chapter focuses on the principles of town ecology and how to think about designing better towns. Part of this is done by summarizing the concepts described throughout the book, which leads to a list of 26 principles subdivided into different categories. Then, suggestions on how ecology can and should be incorporated into the planning of towns and their surrounding land are made. As the author says, a town does not want to be a city, and even less a village. Therefore, goals"
Sisters in Solidarity: Resistance and Agency through Urban Community Food Gardens in Pietermaritzburg,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ab47bcdddf4db64f470c0469462819705ab8e3e,Linda Naicker,"In this article I explore the solidarity, resistance and agency of a group of women involved in an urban community food garden project in collaboration with the Pietermaritzburg Agency for Community Social Action (PACSA). I explore this initiative through the lenses of African Women’s Theology (AWT) and Oikos Theology and suggest that urban community food gardens represent a cooperation with nature and a resistance to social structures and systems that perpetuate marginalization, inequality, and subjugation of women. AWT provides a means to theorize and theologize women’s suffering and agency, and Oikos Theology recognizes the connection between economy and ecology. I tease out how ecological and indigenous wisdom applied in urban community food gardens results in a mutually sustaining relationship between local communities and the earth. I also show how the development of an ecological consciousness not only serves to mitigate food insecurity but empowers women to resist systems and structures of oppression and to embrace affirming and life-giving traditions."

L. P. de Lima; F. Boogaard; R. E. de Graaf-van Dinther,"With climate change and urban development, water systems are changing faster than ever. Currently, the ecological status of water systems is still judged based on single point measurements, without taking into account the spatial and temporal variability of water quality and ecology. There is a need for better and more dynamic monitoring methods and technologies. Aquatic drones are becoming accessible and intuitive tools that may have an important role in water management. This paper describes the outcomes, field experiences and feedback gathered from the use of underwater drones equipped with sensors and video cameras in various pilot applications in The Netherlands, in collaboration with local water managers. It was observed that, in many situations, the use of underwater drones allows one to obtain information that would be costly and even impossible to obtain with other methods and provides a unique combination of three-dimensional data and underwater footage/images. From data collected with drones, it was possible to map different areas with contrasting vegetation, to establish connections between fauna/flora species and local water quality conditions, or to observe variations of water quality parameters with water depth. This study identifies opportunities for the application of this technology, discusses their limitations and obstacles, and proposes recommendation guidelines for new technical designs."

These works take a critical approach to cultural heritage practices in contrast to official discourses that serve state power or justify capital accumulation. Osman Bozkurt’s Scenes, Ali Taptık’s Topographic Nostalgia, and Cemre Yeşil and Maria Sturm’s For Birds’ Sake focus on the relationships between the human and non-human elements of urban geographies. Their projects conceive of heritage as a practice that combines ecological concerns with preserving the cultural remnants of the urban past. Whether critiquing the aesthetic conventions of the picturesque, evoking an affective engagement with the viewer, or conjuring memories of displaced populations, these artists explore different visual approaches to embodying and remembering urban space and place. Taking a cue from their works, this article contemplates the possibility of envisioning heritage futures that can protect Istanbul’s biodiversity while being inclusive of cultural difference."
"The impact of urbanization on socio-economic ­development: the experience of Poland, Spain and Ukraine",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ab98bba83c649e0c710550ac15dccad92cf4ac9,Andrii Buriachenko; J. Koczar; O. Biliavska; Kateryna Levchenko; H. Kolomiiets,"Purpose. To analyze and evaluate the impact of urbanization on socio-economic indicators of development in three different countries and determine how changes in the demographic processes of the urban population affect the economic development and financial stability of the regions.


Methodology. The research methodology is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis and includes the study of demographic characteristics, labor status, education, living conditions and well-being. To carry out such an analysis, statistical methods were used, namely regression analysis, which is used to identify the relationship between urbanization and economic indicators. The use of variation coefficient made it possible to determine the differentiation degree of urbanization level, and the use of correlation coefficients allowed assessing the closeness of the relationship between urbanization and the volume of the produced gross regional product, as well as the country’s financial potential. In general, the regression model provided possibilities to present the dependence between significant factors and determine their influence on the socio-economic development of individual regions.


Findings. The study revealed the multi-component impact of urbanization on the development of regions, namely on the financial potential (measured as GDP per capita) of Poland, Spain and Ukraine. The research analyzed the complexity of urbanization and its impact on various socio-economic factors, such as regional differences, infrastructure concentration and ecological consequences. It has been shown that the significant benefits of urbanization, such as stimulating innovation, creating new jobs and facilitating global trade, can be accompanied by significant investment in urban infrastructure and cause environmental problems or facilitate the spread of disease. The conclusions emphasize the need to implement a national program of “smart cities” part of a long-term development strategy for effective management of urbanization processes. And the importance of further research on urbanization under the conditions of global demographic changes caused by the war in Ukraine is also underlined.


Originality. Based on the analysis of the processes of urbanization in Poland, Spain and Ukraine, the key factors shaping the advantages and disadvantages of urbanization for the socio-economic development of these countries are identified. By means of regression analysis, for each of the researched countries, the dependence between the indicators of population change in urban and rural areas and the volume of the produced gross regional product within each national economy was established, and the existence of a connection between the financial potential of the country and the number of its urban population was also revealed. The influence of urbanization on demographic changes, economic growth, infrastructure and environmental conditions of the studied countries is demonstrated.


Practical value. The article substantiates the data and analyzes the impact of urbanization on various aspects of life in the cities of Poland, Spain, and Ukraine. The results of the study can serve as a basis for developing policies aimed at optimizing urbanization processes, planning the development of urban agglomerations, as well as solving problems related to urban growth and management, including infrastructure, housing, transport and ecology."
Empirical analysis of air quality in Shanghai based on multiple linear regression model,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2acb84aec6d26026bafab80dfafa871327abc522,Botao Cao,"In recent years, with the rapid development of social and economic development, scientific and technological progress, human production and living standards have achieved tremendous improvement, at the same time, a large number of exhaust gases and soot emissions have become important sources of pollution, industrial energy consumption and urban construction, etc. make China's air environment pollution problem increasingly serious. The air quality in China gradually presents regional pollution, especially in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei regions. This paper takes Shanghai as the research object and empirically analyzes the main influencing factors of its air quality, which can provide reference not only for managing the air quality of this city, but also for the air quality management of similar cities. This paper empirically investigates the influencing factors of air quality in Shanghai based on the Shanghai air quality monitoring data, including AQI (Air Quality Index) and PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2 and O3 pollutant concentrations, released by the Shanghai Bureau of Ecology and Environment from January 2015 to October 2021. This paper uses the knowledge of econometrics to establish a multiple linear regression model with the help of RStudio, which is continuously estimated, tested and improved on the basis of the primary model to analyze the degree of influence of pollutants on AQI, and also to analyze the main pollutants affecting air quality by testing. The statistical results show that the primary air pollutants in Shanghai are O3 and NO2. Based on the analysis results, this paper puts forward corresponding suggestions about improving the air quality and protecting the ecological environment in Shanghai."
Spatial Aspects of Gardens Drive Ranging in Urban Foxes (Vulpes vulpes): The Resource Dispersion Hypothesis Revisited,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2af0047f55683f7813c0d8d9fb0f265f113ecda7,Bryony A. Tolhurst; R. Baker; F. Cagnacci; D. Scott,"Simple Summary Red foxes are a well-established species of urban ecosystems in the UK and worldwide. Understanding how foxes use urban landscapes is important for urban biodiversity and disease management. The Resource Dispersion Hypothesis (RDH) proposes that home range size is smaller in larger, better quality habitats and increases as such habitats become patchier. Here, we tested the RDH for foxes in the city of Brighton and Hove, focusing on predominantly residential areas, as foxes are reported to prefer residential gardens to other urban habitats. We compared fox range size according to extent of garden land cover and varying garden size and configuration. We tracked 20 foxes (12 males and 8 females) with satellite collars recording at 15 min intervals for several weeks over four seasons to determine their range size and internal structure. We then measured garden size and configuration within fox ranges using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We found that foxes had smaller ranges in areas containing few, large, well-connected gardens and larger ranges where numerous smaller gardens were crisscrossed by internal barriers (e.g., fences, walls) or fragmented by other habitats. Our findings confirm the RDH, showing that habitat dispersion can be used to predict fox movement in cities with relevance to urban planning. Abstract Red foxes are a well-established species of urban ecosystems in the UK and worldwide. Understanding the spatial ecology of foxes in urban landscapes is important for enhancement of urban biodiversity and effective disease management. The Resource Dispersion Hypothesis (RDH) holds that territory (home range) size is linked to distribution and richness of habitat patches such that aggregation of rich resources should be negatively associated with range size. Here, we tested the RDH on a sample of 20 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in the city of Brighton and Hove. We focused on residential garden areas, as foxes were associated with these in previous studies. We equipped 12 male and 8 female foxes with GPS collars recording at 15 min intervals during discrete seasons over four years. We regressed fox core area size against garden size, number of garden patches, and edge density within and between patches as extracted from GIS in a series of bivariate linear mixed models. We found that foxes used smaller core areas where gardens were large and well-connected and larger core areas where numerous, smaller gardens were fragmented by internal barriers (e.g., fences, walls) or bisected by other habitats such as managed grassland or built-up areas. Our findings confirm the RDH and help to inform future urban planning for wildlife."
ECOLOGICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL ASPECTS OF CHANGES IN THE HYDROCHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF WATER OF THE RIVER MOUTH IN THE CITY OF RIVNE,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2afca0cd3a7510ed0317da03de754581fac03bf7,Mikola Vasilovich Yackov; A. D. Kalko; Angelina Andriivna Lidavec,"Aim. The purpose of this study is the ecological-geographical analysis of the change in the hydrochemical composition of the river Ustya after it flows through the city of Rivne and the extent of anthropogenic transformation of the landscape mosaic of the coastal areas as a result of economic activity uncontrolled by various institutions and organizations by the population and enterprises of the city. The article was a continuation of a series of publications made together with students of the National Academy of Sciences, and is devoted to the study of the quality and composition of surface waters of the Rivne region as a result of the transformation of the components of the natural environment. Method. In the scientific work, the results of local research were analyzed in the performance of the assigned tasks, where general scientific and special methods were used: landscape ecology (geosystem), structural-functional and methods of standard processing of hydrological and hydrochemical information, hydrological calculations. In order to analyze the factors of transformation and formation of the quality of drinking water, the methods of statistical analysis, analogy, interpolation, zoning were used. The results. According to the results of the hydrochemical analysis based on the educational laboratory of the SSU ""Rivne technical vocational college NUWM"", the content of pollutants exceeds the normative values. For example, the iron content below the city of Rivne is 9.3 times higher than its content above the city. Sulfates in river water at a norm of 150 mg/l, above the city of Rivne - 260 mg/l, and below - 328 mg/l. It is also noted that river water is contaminated with ammonium nitrogen by a factor of 2. Water acidity exceeds the norm in the sample of Myrotyn village. In both samples, there is an excess of hardness and alkalinity indicators, which negatively affects the development of the ichthyofauna of the Ustya River. From the comparative analysis of river water, it is obvious that the content of polluting components is exceeded due to the crazy technogenic influence of the urban agglomeration. The scientific novelty consists of an ecological and geographical analysis of the influence of anthropogenic activities on the transformation of landscapes in the coastal zone of the Ustya River within the city of Rivne, the qualitative and quantitative composition and condition of representatives of flora and fauna, as well as the aquatic environment. The analysis was carried out as part of a research project to establish the ecological state of the Ustya River. Practical significance. The results of the research can be used in the educational process of SSU ""Rivne technical professional college of NUWM"", Volyn National University named after Lesya Ukrainka, National University of Water and Environmental Management, SSU ""Kostopil construction and technological professional college of NUWM"" and other educational institutions in teaching geographic, environmental, chemical, economic and local history disciplines. The results will find their application in the legislative and executive work of local self-government bodies when developing programs for socio-economic development of the territorial community of the city of Rivne. Research materials will contribute to the rational use of natural and anthropogenically transformed resources of the Rivne Region. A number of provisions can be used in similar studies of other regions of Ukraine."
HOW CARBON IMMOBILIZATION FROM RESTORED MARINE FORESTS MAY HELP CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION PLANS?,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b08485ca6e683ee25ab9e4ddada0244888b35c8,S. Rossi,"The ocean transformation due to the direct or indirect human influence is a fact. One of the most affected ecosystems are the benthic ones, where bottom trawling, urban/agricultural development and climate change (among other things) deeply transform the bottom communities. Among these threatened communities, the marine forest is the most extended. The marine forest is composed of benthic macroalgae, phanerogams and suspension feeders (sponges, corals, gorgonians, etc.) which conform three-dimensional living structures. Coral reefs, seaweeds, sponge grounds, seagrasses, oyster banks, cold water corals are some examples of this vast set of ecosystems dispersed all over the world. During the last two decades, the concept of Blue Carbon has been consolidated, describing the stocked carbon in vegetated coastal and marine habitats such as mangroves, salt marshes, seagrasses and seaweeds. There are also world-wide numbers about how much carbon is retained in the terrestrial forests, crops and soils. These systems act as carbon immobilizers from which we have proxies. Can we design and apply an ambitious shallow and deep marine forest restoration plan to help climate change mitigation? The aim of thispaper is developing a simplified realistic calculation of the role as carbon immobilizers of a restored marine forests in one area as a case study, setting up a huge restoration plan to help mitigating climate change, enhancing carbon retention. A shallow (10-30 meters depth) restoration plan of the marine animal forests with new technologies based on symbiotic artificial reefs, enhancing the role as carbon immobilizers and creating a protocol to help the climate change mitigation, is explained, using realistic numbers to calculate the real impact of such regenerative plan. Is time to have a much more applied and holistic view of what is in the ocean’s floors in terms of habitat composition, complexity and biomass stocks, implementing new methods and technologies that are already in our hands. It is also time to give a chance to the oceans in helping in the climate change mitigation plans applying brave new restoration approaches that may change our relation with the sea.

River Cities in Asia,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b160e8b289b2786e247ff706fda5e66f70f8753,Rita Padawangi; Paul E. Rabé; Adrian Perkasa,"River Cities in Asia uncovers the intimate relationship between rivers and cities in Asia from a multi-disciplinary perspective in the humanities and the social sciences. As rivers have shaped human settlement patterns, economies, culture and rituals, so too have humans impacted the flow and health of rivers. In Asia, the sheer scale of urbanization increases the urgency of addressing challenges facing urban rivers, leading to the importance of historically, socially, and culturally relevant solutions. However, cities are also uneven landscapes of power, affecting chances to achieve holistic ecological approaches. The central premise of River Cities in Asia is that a “river city” is one where proximity between a river and a city exists across time and space, natural and social dimensions. Recognition of these deep connections can help to better contextualize policy solutions aimed at rivers and their ecologies, including human life."
The ecological and evolutionary consequences of systemic racism in urban environments,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b1dfaf18ceafc5b83e57dd41000f260fdf7603e,Christopher J. Schell; Karen Dyson; T. L. Fuentes; S. Des Roches; Nyeema C. Harris; D. Miller; C. Woelfle-Erskine; M. Lambert,"Imprints of racism Cities create challenging environments for many nonhuman species, and the presence of nonhumans in cities influences the health and well-being of the humans with which they share the environment. Distinct urban conditions are created by landscape modification, but the history of this transformation is not equal across urban environments. Schell et al. review how systematic racist practices such as residential segregation, enacted in part through redlining, have led to an unequal distribution of “nature” within cities. These inequities continue to play out in both the ecological processes of cites and the welfare of their residents. Science, this issue p. eaay4497 BACKGROUND Human activity and decisions drive all life in cities. Worldwide, cities are characterized by extensive anthropogenic transformation of the landscape, modification of biogeochemical processes, and alteration of biological communities. Underlying all of these characteristics of urban ecosystems is an extraordinary variability in human agency, culture, power, and identity. Though our understanding of cities as ecological systems with distinctive community assemblages and landscape features has broadened considerably, researchers still rarely consider the full range of social drivers that affect landscape heterogeneity. One of the most characteristic attributes of cities is social inequality—specifically the uneven distribution of resources and wealth primarily underpinned by structural racism and classism. Because structural inequalities form the foundation of city infrastructure, urban development, governance, management, and landscape heterogeneity, inequality among humans defines the ecological setting and evolutionary trajectories for all urban organisms. More broadly, systematic inequities have profound impacts on global biological change and biodiversity loss. Many emergent social inequity patterns are principally driven by systemic racism and white supremacy. Hence, centering racial and economic justice in urban biological research and conservation is imperative. Here, we show how social inequalities shape ecological and evolutionary processes in U.S. cities and highlight the need for research that integrates justice perspectives with ecological and evolutionary dynamics. ADVANCES Although a rich literature demonstrates how historical and contemporary inequities emerge and persist in human systems, a transdisciplinary perspective that integrates social and cultural processes into an urban eco-evolutionary framework remains unexplored. In today’s world, humans often shape the ecological conditions that drive patterns of species distribution and evolution. Distinctive urban landscape features—including reduced habitat patch size, novel plant communities, and increased distance among similar patches—affect key ecological processes such as population dynamics, species interactions, and food web structure. Recent research emphasizes that socioeconomic and demographic factors predict within-city variation in diverse environmental conditions. Humans directly control urban plant, animal, and microbe communities. Further, decisions about urban resource management are often dictated by a subset of individuals and institutions with social or economic capital. These decisions can bias the distribution of societal benefits derived from nature. Dominant social groups also enact and enforce policies and societal norms that exacerbate social and environmental inequities. Wealthier and predominantly white neighborhoods generally have more green space, more trees, and greater plant diversity than less affluent neighborhoods. In addition, synergies among pollution (e.g., light, noise, chemical), resource distribution, subsidized predators, and non-native species present novel challenges to organisms, which must respond by moving elsewhere, acclimatizing, adapting, or facing local extirpation. These stressors are often stratified according to racial and/or ethnic backgrounds and wealth. Further, intraspecific variation in phenotypic and genotypic traits of urban species may reflect human-induced disturbances. These relationships highlight the potential for both adaptive and neutral evolutionary processes in urban subpopulations to vary across neighborhoods within cities. OUTLOOK Stratification of wealth and property ownership shapes the distribution and management of urban spaces, thus constructing the urban ecosystem. Systemic racism and classism drive urban wealth stratification, emphasizing the need to address inequality-driven environmental heterogeneity in urban ecological and evolutionary studies. Residential segregation and colonial annexation (as well as gentrification and displacement) generate predictable ecological patterns in vegetation, air and water quality, microclimate, soils, and the built environment through the rapid influx of resources to specific areas. Accounting for such processes will allow more accurate estimation of the effect of humans on urban organisms. Deconstructing the complex and nuanced attributes of social inequality in affecting biological phenomena can also inform more equitable and sustainable urban planning solutions that implement anti-racist and justice-centered actions. Racial oppression and economic injustice are jeopardizing urban and global ecosystem health and function. Structural racism and classism are further layered with other inequalities, thus necessitating an intersectional approach to urban ecology. Deeper integration across the natural and social sciences is therefore an urgent priority for advancing our understanding of urban ecosystems and developing applied solutions that promote environmental justice, equity, and sustainability. Residential segregation and systemic racism have substantial impacts on ecological and evolutionary dynamics in cities. Government-sponsored policies stratify neighborhoods on the basis of race and class (e.g., through “redlining” in the United States, represented here by the red circle), which results in restricted access to social services and environmental amenities for racial and/or ethnic minorities and low-income communities (red arrows). Habitat quantity and quality tend to be greater in wealthier and predominantly white neighborhoods (green arrows), which leads to variations in ecological and evolutionary processes, underscoring the influence of systemic racism and inequality in driving urban landscape characteristics. Urban areas are dynamic ecological systems defined by interdependent biological, physical, and social components. The emergent structure and heterogeneity of urban landscapes drives biotic outcomes in these areas, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies have effectively considered structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes and have instead focused on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. In this analysis, we explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships that bind social inequities—specifically racism—and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices, including residential segregation, to the heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. In the future, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors that drive biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct urbanization’s biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience to global environmental change."
The Importance of Urban Greening Spaces for Avian Communities in an Urbanized Landscape,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b372199d443d10594ee059543f3dae1db09f825,G. Kopij,"Island ecology plays an important role in explaining various ecological and evolutionary processes. Small, isolated oceanic islands, exemplified by the Azores Archipelago, are especially vulnerable to adverse environmental conditions and human impact. The study aims to evaluate the impact of urbanization, especially the urban greening space, on the structure and dynamics of avian communities associated with various landforms in an urbanized landscape in one of the nine islands of the Azores Archipelago, São Miguel Island, in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. Samples were collected in the second half of April 2024. The line transect method (43 transects with a total of 37.4 km) was employed to count all bird species breeding in different landforms distinguished in the city: coastal land, urbanized land, rural land, and urban greening space. The obtained results showed that the number of breeding species was much higher in urban greening spaces (n = 20) than in the other lands (n = 10–14 species). Both cumulative dominance and dominance indices were much lower in urban greening space than in the other landforms. The Sørensen Index of Similarity between the four main land categories distinguished in the city varied between 0.62 and 0.96, being the lowest between the coastal and urban greening space, and the highest between the urbanized and rural lands. Two main feeding guilds were distinguished in the study area: granivores and insectivores. The former guild clearly dominated over the latter in all major land categories distinguished. Clearly, the proportion of granivores increased with urbanization. Also, two nesting guilds were distinguished: buildings and trees/shrubs. The former was dominant in all land categories except for the urban greening space where the tree/shrub nesting guild was more numerous than the building guild. The tree/shrub guild declined with urbanization. A general trend was recorded: the higher the level of urbanization, the lower the percentage of urban greening space, and in consequence, the lower the number of bird species and diversity indices, but the higher the cumulative dominance and dominance indices. The overall density of birds remains, however, distinctively similar. In the future, data on the population densities and dominance of particular species should be collected in urbanized landforms in other towns of the Azores Archipelago and Macaronesia at large."

In cities 70% of the precipitation is lost due to inefficient drainage systems. The network of urban water bodies plays a crucial role to retain this water, encourage groundwater recharge and to prevent flooding. However, the urban design and planning processes often neglect the diverse potential of the blue-green infrastructure and the adjoining buffer spaces along the drains, canals, and rivers.The research identifies the Lohia canal in Greater Noida as a potential pedestrian and cycle network, a social space, and an eco-sensitive zone for conservation of existing biodiversity and develops an applied research framework. The research methods are primary field studies, interviews, mapping, and photography along the 8 kms stretch of canal to identify issues associated with the negligence of the canal in urban settings. This study is utilized to develop an integrated vision for revitalization of three layers of canal that are – 1. the climatic resilience, 2. the urban ecology and 3. the social spaces. The scheme thus proposes intervention at the seven locations for placemaking and ecological restoration through a series of connected and integrated design interventions."

The case study is the third phase of an ongoing research project_the Hotspot Cities Project_at the McHarg Center for Urbanism and Ecology at the University of Pennsylvania. The first phase involved an audit of land use in the world’s biodiversity hotspots in relation to the Convention on Biological Diversity.1 The second involved mapping the projected 2030 urban growth of 463 cities in the hotspots, identifying the conflict between sprawl and endangered species. The set of 463 cities was then reduced to thirty-three by selecting the largest and fastest-growing of these cities in each respective hotspot, the so-called ‘hotspot cities’.2 Conservationists were then partnered with planners to represent these cities at a symposium at the University of Pennsylvania in June 2019 to share their experiences in regard to the conflict between urban growth and biodiversity occurring in their respective cities. In this third phase of the research, we take one of these hotspot cities, Bogotá, as a case study and_through a research-by-design process_ask whether conservation values and urban development can be symbiotic and how this can be explicitly reflected in the spatial planning of the city."

Actions such as lockdown taken by the majority of countries in the world aiming at preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus influenced many different areas including surrounding us soundscape. Devoid of noise and sounds associated with human activity soundscape of cities attracted attention not only of researchers and sound ecologists but also people not professionally related to sound studies. Such a great interest in sound space was primarily due to the scale of the changes that affected it. In order to better understand the nature of these changes and the response to them, I begin by presenting the state of the audiosphere before the pandemic, as well as the achievements in the field of acoustic ecology—a research direction that emerged in response to the state of sound space at the time. Referring to the writings of acoustic ecology pioneer Raymond M. Schafer and the continuators of his thought I present the role of sound in the city and its impact on humans. I also explain terms that have emerged from soundscape studies that make it easier to navigate the issues I am addressing. The knowledge presented in this way provides a starting point for understanding the sound pandemic situation, which I draw on the basis of a review of popular science literature such as BBC Future, Scientific American and The Washington Post. Using them, I present the areas in which audible changes took place and the reactions to these changes. I also describe the educational action taken at the time to explain the audible situation and to exploit its sonic potential. This overview concludes with an attempt to outline the future of the urban soundscape, based on the opinions of the authors of the mentioned publications as well as my own conclusions."
Quantification and Simulation of Landscape Anthropization around the Mining Agglomerations of Southeastern Katanga (DR Congo) between 1979 and 2090,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b696e06e038a83df98502ffa7503fd48fe4e518,H.

Sikuzani,"In Southeastern Katanga, mining activities are (in)directly responsible for deforestation, ecosystem degradation and unplanned building densification. However, little is known about these dynamics at the local level. First, we quantify the landscape anthropization around four agglomerations of Southeastern Katanga (Lubumbashi, Likasi, Fungurume and Kolwezi) in order to assess the applicability of the Nature–Agriculture-Urbanization model based on the fact that natural landscapes are replaced by anthropogenic landscapes, first dominated by agricultural production, and then built-up areas. Secondly, we predict evolutionary trends of landscape anthropization by 2090 through the first-order Markov chain. Mapping coupled with landscape ecology analysis tools revealed that the natural cover that dominated the landscape in 1979 lost more than 60% of its area in 41 years (1979–2020) around these agglomerations in favor of agricultural and energy production, the new landscape matrix in 2020, but also built-up areas. These disturbances, amplified between 2010 and 2020, are more significant around Lubumbashi and Kolwezi agglomerations. Built-up areas which spread progressively will become the dominant process by 2060 in Lubumbashi and by 2075 in Kolwezi. Our results confirm the applicability of the Nature–Agriculture-Urbanization model to the tropical context and underline the urgency to put in place a territorial development plan and alternatives regarding the use of charcoal as a main energy source in order to decrease the pressure on natural ecosystems, particularly in peri-urban areas."

Seasonal dynamics of Podzoluvisol moisture and bulk density in the slope catena at the Forestry Experimental Station of the RSAU-MTAA at different levels of recreational load,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b717f224414ddbacab5fca6023285bb12d581a1,S. Melese; I. Vasenev,"The seasonal dynamics of soil moisture, bulk density and moisture reserve in the topsoil of Podzoluvisol representative variants at the Forest Experimental Station of the RSAU-MTAA at various levels of recreational load is investigated. The assessment of the influence of recreational load on the surface horizons (A1, A1A2, A2) of Podzoluvisols within the slope catena (the summit of the moraine hill – the middle part of the slope – the lower part of the slope) is given. Three levels of recreational load are considered: minimal (background), medium and strong. The analysis of soil moisture was carried out by the thermal weight method, one of the bulk density – according to N.A. Kachinsky method, using 100 cm3 mortise cylinders – in triple repetition. The results were statistically processed using ANOVA in accordance with the GLM (IBM SPSS) version 25 procedure. The conducted research revealed a pronounced seasonal dynamic of the studied properties of Podzoluvisols with a clear differentiation according to their position in the catena and the level of recreational load. Summer soil moisture values of the surface A1 horizons can be 2.5 times lower than spring ones. Soil moisture at the slope foot is 1.1–1.5 times higher than at the summit of the moraine hill. The main consequence of the recreational load increasing is a significant rise in the bulk density of the topsoil horizons A1 – A2, maximally expressed in conditions of increased soil moisture in the lower part of the catena. Moisture reserves in the topsoil significantly decrease with an increase in recreational load and the associated soil bulk density. The soil bulk density is higher in summer than in spring and early autumn. The established dependences of seasonal dynamics of soil moisture, bulk density and moisture reserve in the topsoil on the slope steepness and recreational load will be useful for planning and environmentally safe regulation of spatially differentiated recreational load in different parts of the urban slope landscape, even in case of a slight slope steepness (up to 3-4 °) and of the presence of vegetation cover close to natural conditions.

A. Kospanov; Pavel I. Konstantinov,"The current development level of urban meteorology as a synthetic science that includes elements of climatology,ecology, urban studies, and computational mathematics requires the creation of adequate databases of meteorological parameters:only in this way can they be properly used for solving problems of both applied sciences and fundamental research.Therefore, obtaining information on the intra-urban distribution of air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed mustmeet the most stringent quality criteria. The most modern method for obtaining high-resolution databases is hydrodynamic modeling with the use of regional weather and climate forecast models (WRF, COSMO_RU, ENVIRO-HIRLAM, etc.).However, for horizontal resolution of about a kilometer it is already necessary to use so-called multilevel parameterizationsof the urban surface layer of the atmosphere, which take into account the vertical structure within the urban area. For this purpose, it seems promising to adapt the most modern physically based parameterizations of the lower atmosphere, such as Building EnergyParameterization (BEP) and Building Energy Model (BEM), for the popular, freely distributed regional model WRF-ARW, whichhas been used in our study for the Moscow region (Moscow + Moscow Oblast). The article reviews the advantages of this approachand the results of the first computational experiments. We provide estimates of the accuracy of temperature and relative humiditysimulation for a full-fledged experiment on dynamic downscaling of ERA5 reanalysis data within the Moscow region for 2010 (as aperiod with notable seasonal temperature contrasts, including the infamous extreme heat wave over European Russia)."
Spatiotemporal Relationship Between Carbon Metabolism and Ecosystem Service Value in the Rural Production–Living–Ecological Space of Northeast China’s Black Soil Region: A Case Study of Bin County,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2bb6f60f8be0639a30ab0f706dfbf3d1fde1052d,Yajie Shang; Yuanyuan Chen; Yalin Zhai; Lei Wang,"Amid global climate challenges and an urgent need for ecological protection, the northeastern black soil region—one of the world’s remaining “three major black soil regions”—confronts significant tensions between agricultural economic development and land ecological protection, threatening national food security. Based on the “production–ecology–life” (PLE) classification system, this study established a dual-dimensional evaluation for carbon metabolism and ESV in horizontal and vertical dimensions. The horizontal flow of carbon and ESV was traced across different ecosystems, while the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon metabolism and ESV were analyzed vertically. Spatial autocorrelation analyses were employed to examine the interaction patterns between carbon metabolism and ESV. The findings reveal that (1) cropland production space remains the dominant spatial type, exhibiting fluctuating patterns in the size of other spatial types, with a notable reduction in water ecological space. (2) From 2000 to 2020, high-value carbon metabolism density areas were primarily concentrated in the central region, while low-value areas gradually decreased in size. Cropland production space and urban living space served as key compartments and dominant pathways for carbon flow transfer in the two periods, respectively. (3) The total ecosystem service value (ESV) showed a downward trend, decreasing by CNY 1.432 billion from 2000 to 2020. The spatial distribution pattern indicates high values in the center and northwest, contrasting with lower values in the southeast. The flow of ecological value from forest ecological space to cropland production space represents the main loss pathway.

Regional ecosophy: a Guattarian approach to the border landscapes of the Irish Northwest,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2bcaf64c89e3dbc0020c6427698186cf95fca17b,Gareth Doherty; Pol Fité Matamoros,"In this paper, we propose that landscape architecture is uniquely equipped to shape highly contested and politicized border regions. We contend that recognizing landscape architecture’s agency to contribute to national and international politics may enable the field to intervene in contemporary theoretical discussions within urban and regional studies that are otherwise dominated by geography and urban planning. Through the example of the Irish/Northern Irish border region in the face of Brexit, we discuss the limits to city planning and policy designations—such as that of city-region—in addressing the complex economies and ecologies of similar geopolitical landscapes. We also highlight environmentalist planning and design’s limitations in addressing the complex social practices and subjectivities that weave together regions like the Irish Northwest. Our alternative is a fieldwork-based “ecosophical” approach capable of addressing Félix Guattari’s social, environmental, and subjective ecologies in an integrated manner. With this, we establish how such an approach can offer a more nuanced set of tools to design and plan for larger regional landscapes."

DEVELOPING OF INDICATORS FOR ASSESSING THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF CITY TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2be120a8b6591309d1cc2b46e1f445d582b70c4a,Oleksandr Cherednichenko,"Sustainable development of urban transport systems is an urgent task of the modern world. High population density and a significant number of industrial enterprises and enterprises in the service sector require not only ensuring the mobility of city residents and the economic activity of enterprises, but also the creation of comfortable living conditions with the preservation of ecology and natural parks in the urban landscape. Incorrect transport planning of the late 20th and early 21st centuries led to rapidly growing motorization and long traffic delays. The created concepts of the development of the transport infrastructure of large cities require constant measurement of the results of changes and correction if necessary. First of all, the work defines the concept of ""city transport systems"" and their classification. Social and non-social (quantitative, qualitative) indicators used to characterize urban transport systems are described. The main requirements for the urban monitoring system and its key structural elements are given. A monitoring system is proposed, in which the basic management goals related to infrastructural changes (Task 1), the attitudes of users of transport services (Task 2), as well as the impact on the economy (Task 3) and development costs (Task 4) are highlighted. 5 groups of indicators have been formed, which can be used to monitor the development of the city's transport systems: intensity, safety, accessibility, convenience and connectivity. Among the indicators, there are both indicators of objective assessment (""hard"" indicators) and indicators of subjective assessment (""soft"" indicators). The information base of the article consists of publications by prominent Ukrainian and foreign scientists, data from the Tom Tom transport analytics service, and the current legal framework of Ukraine, which regulates urban transport systems, and urban development strategies. The following methods of scientific research were used for the research: dialectical method, method of scientific abstraction, method of content analysis, method of analysis and synthesis, comparative method, method of generalization and graphic method."

The emergence of socio-environmental conflicts around urban-real estate extractivism",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2be5a8ffcd8f654062409456a87b6c6325e0da63,Sofía Astelarra,"Within the framework of the “Jornadas Fundamentos y Aplicaciones de la Interdisciplina” (JFAI) and the roundtable ""Nature, socio-territorial conflicts and socio-environmental issues"" we will address the following questions: What disputes arise in the context of social struggles for the appropriation, management and use of nature? How does the deepening of the extractivist model affect the different social actors, such as native peoples, fumigated peoples, peasant movements, local/regional organizations and/or assemblies, among others?To do so, I will take as a starting point the phrase ""living in contact with nature"" and I will focus on the emergence of socio-environmental conflicts around urban-real estate extractivism, since these narratives are deployed by the social actors involved. The key of analysis from which to read these conflicts is the field of American political ecology and with contributions from critical geography and sociology. For the understanding and analysis of socio-environmental conflicts I use the methodology proposed by Merlinsky (2013), for which I make a historical journey that begins in the mid-1990s, when the first controversies are recorded in the public spheres in the Partido de Tigre; from the systematization the emblematic cases with their dynamics and main milestones have been determined"

Higher education institutions (HEIs) bear particular responsibility for sustainability-aware designers able to implement specific measures in this field. This paper presents a typology of design solutions for urban contexts intended to implement Sustainable Development Goal 11, which refers to making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, which can be included in university curricula. The study presents a comprehensive source base of possible interpretations of sustainability guidelines in architectural, landscape, and transport solution design and can be used to guide and assess projects in these fields. Solutions identified and analyzed were grouped into four dimensions related to sustainability aspects (accessibility, ecology, functionality, and identity). The framework proposed was developed based on the teaching experience of thesis design projects and practice-based workshop course projects featured in the curricula of first and second cycle Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and Transport programs taught at the Cracow University of Technology, Poland. The projects were prepared as a part of workshop-based public consultations for a real-world project—the construction of a transport hub in Hrubieszów, Poland. The most complex implementation of various individual sustainable design solutions was linked to the interdisciplinarity of the design team and the broadest public participation spectrum."
Mapping Global Urban Impervious Surface and Green Space Fractions Using Google Earth Engine,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c07953a35c44d27f2fa89568170348f153a691d,W. Kuang; Yali Hou; Yinyin Dou; D. Lu; Shiqi Yang,"Urban impervious surfaces area (ISA) and green space (GS), two primary components of urban environment, are pivotal in detecting urban environmental quality and addressing global environmental change issues. However, the current global mapping of ISA and GS is not effective enough to accurately delineate in urban areas due to the mosaicked and complex structure. To address the issue, the hierarchical architecture principle and subpixel metric method were applied to map 30 m global urban ISA and GS fractions for the years 2015 and circa 2020. We use random forest algorithms for retrieval of the Normalized Settlement Density Index and Normalized Green Space Index from Landsat images using Google Earth Engine. The correlation coefficients of global urban ISA and GS fractions were all higher than 0.9 for 2015 and circa 2020. Our results show global urban ISA and GS areas in circa 2020 were 31.19 × 104 km2 and 17.16 × 104 km2, respectively. The novel ISA and GS fractions product can show potential applications in assessing the effects of urbanization on climate, ecology, and urban sustainability."

From photo documentation to photo diagrams: a technique to make civic ecologies present and legible,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c197ab729cefa8799fdd90ebe4af0cb1ed84a39,Sarah Jane Jones; Alexandra Crosby; I. Vanni,"The visualization of nature in cities fundamentally impacts how we imagine the urban environment and our role in caring for it. Across Australia, the project of urban renewal imagines and designs specific typologies of urban nature. These typologies can obscure grass root forms of environmental stewardship and their connection through civic ecologies. Yet, at this time of environmental change, residents’ engagement with urban ecologies is vital. What role might visual communication play in helping to make these civic ecologies initiatives more legible? This article discusses an experiment creating photo diagrams, which expands visual methodologies used in place-based research, such as photo documentation and visual ethnography. Iterative photography augmented by ethnographies enables us to ‘read’ the landscape. Diagrams support us in expanding the photographs in three crucial moves. First, desaturation reveals examples of civic ecologies. Second, tracing exposes the networks and relations that constitute them. And, third, text and lines of flight draw out how civic ecologies extend beyond specific sites and connect to other places. In this way, this article makes three contributions. The first is to experiment with ways to make grass root civic ecologies legible in their complexities to recuperate practices marginalized by top-down socio-ecological processes of urban renewal. The second proposes photo diagrams as a medium moving between photography as descriptive documentation and documentation of non-representational dimensions. Finally, the third brings a visual communication perspective into debates on conveying the non-representational in visual form."

This paper examines the effects of city deluge as a result of urban assemblage: complex, distributed and disjunctive relations between the city’s amphibious ecologies and landscapes, its dilapidated drainage infrastructure, its varied transport systems, its weather patterns, and the movements of people. During cloudbursts, many of Bangkok’s missing masses become plainly and frustratingly, visible. Using ethnographic description as a “material diagnostics,” I explore how irritated, perturbed, urban atmospheres emerge out of disjunctive infrastructural constellations. Cloudbursts make perceptible such atmospheres as forms of sentient urbanism, in which distributed sensations are generated by intersecting material itineraries moving across multiple assemblages. As affects and agitations move from street level to social media, rain precipitates matters of urgent, urban concern and critique."

Urban political ecology between the planetary and the situated: Extending the debate through critical logistics,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c7cb6f04869efab092efc3746f1f972bbe0cad3,Miriam Matthiessen,"
 This article examines a debate regarding future orientations for the field of Urban Political Ecology (UPE). Anchored in two UPE discourses toward a more planetary or a more situated UPE, I argue that these discourses present two critical yet independent responses to early UPE scholarship, opening up the possibility for a more synthesising position. Building off of this debate as well as some of UPE's intellectual traditions, I then argue for a rapprochement between UPE and the field of critical logistics, using the 2022 expansion of the IJmuiden sea lock in the Netherlands as an illustrative case for demonstrating how applying the combined theoretical and methodological insights of UPE and critical logistics can turn a seemingly mundane sea lock infrastructure into a key site from which to draw out the political stakes of urban and climate futures as they play out in a city like Amsterdam. A closer engagement with critical logistics can not only extend UPE's existing themes and empirical focal points, but also attend to theoretical tensions regarding the politics of scale and place central to the debate between a more planetary and a more situated UPE. Finally, I argue that this rapprochement is not only theoretical and methodological but also political, as the wealth of work in critical logistics on articulating a
 counterlogistics
 can help UPE expand its political project in a time of climate emergency and interlocking capitalist crises.

The Association between Rapid Urbanization Process and Mangrove Land Use Changes in Coastal Regions of Mainland China: A ten-years Systematic Review,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ca962767790f7f62feacc242e899145e01e8902,Wanzhen Xu; N. A. Majid,"Objective: This research aims to summarize the impacts on mangroves in mainland China due to changes in land use patterns in the context of rapid urbanization.
 
Theoretical Framework: Grounded in theories of urbanization, land use change, and ecosystem dynamics, this research adopts a theoretical framework that integrates concepts from geography, ecology, and urban studies. It explores the complex interactions between urban development and mangrove ecosystems, considering factors such as population growth, economic development, and policy interventions.
 
Method: The systematic literature review method used in this study follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. From 359 papers, 14 were selected for review and summary based on sources and identification, inclusion and exclusion criteria, screening, and data extraction.
 
Results and Discussion: We realize that development activities that land use, such as land reclamation and port construction, pose the most significant threat to mangroves, often leading to irreversible damage. In addition to the obvious destruction, the covert and sustained impacts of urban development on mangrove forests have been receiving increasing attention. To address the negative impact of substantial demand for construction land, the establishment of protected areas at different levels has been proven to be indeed effective. However, the sustainable development of management and service functions within protected areas requires further research.
 
Research Implications: Understanding the specific impacts of the urbanization process on mangrove forests is crucial for mangrove restoration efforts and for formulating and adjusting urban development-related plans and policies.
 
Originality/Value: This study assesses urbanization impacts on mangroves, detailing loss reasons and distinguishing explicit and implicit effects of construction. It evaluates protective measures and discusses tailored conservation strategies for sustainable mangrove management."

Yet ecological values and activism are more important than ever, as Russia’s citizens must contend with the exacerbation of natural resource destruction and climate crisis ramifications on an accelerated and unprecedented scale. The articles featured in this finale double issue of our journal were solicited well before the war began in February 2022, but most have been written and revised since, with each author feeling a sense of urgency and distress. What began as a project to highlight the ecology activist successes in a few high-profile cases illustrating civic society mobilization in Russia has instead moved to analyzing disaster zones in various degrees of devastation. What can we learn from the experiences of valiant ecology activists and besieged civic society leaders? How can Indigenous knowledge gleaned and practiced over centuries help in managing ecological and societal stresses? How can Russia’s urban scientific and rural Indigenous communities communicate productively with each other, especially when some scientists are Indigenous? How could state legal and policy mechanisms mitigate environmental destruction rather than abet it? These are some of the questions asked in this issue. The authors come from diverse backgrounds, Russian and non-Russian, rural and urban, scientific and political, activist and scholarly. Each article qualifies as anthropology in the best, broadest sense of the word. The authors are ethnographic in their descriptions, sensitive to human rights at many levels, and strive to accurately portray the voices of their interlocutors. Each case featured here resonates beyond the local, although their venues and contexts may not be well known or understood in the European or English-language-oriented world.

Here we review the state of the field of “tropical urban ecology.” We first evaluated and propose ecological hypotheses about how tropical versus extratropical species and ecosystems might differ from one another in how they respond to urbanization pressures. While data remain limited, we expect that tropical biodiversity should be at least as vulnerable to urbanization (and potentially more vulnerable) than extratropical biodiversity. We also examined the importance of ecosystem services in tropical cities and demonstrate the challenges in quantifying, managing, and sustaining these across diverse socioeconomic and environmental contexts. Finally, we propose an agenda for moving the field of tropical urban ecology forward through an interdisciplinary lens that synthesizes recent advances in both urban ecology and tropical biology. Specifically, advances and development in community science, Earth observation, environmental justice, One Health, and land sparing/sharing strategies could lead to major steps forward in the conservation of biodiversity in tropical cities. As the world urbanizes increasingly in biodiverse‐rich tropical ecosystems, we must have strong conceptual frameworks and increased data/attention on both the ecological and human communities most impacted by these significant global changes."
Ecological engineering approaches to restoring the aquatic biological community of an urban pond ecosystem and its effects on water quality ‑ a case study of the urban Xixi National Wetland Park in China,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2cf7f5dd1969173e249746554624ea68144c34b4,F. Liu; Jianbo Lu,"There is a global increase in urbanization, which contributes to the loss and fragmentation of urban wetland and pond habitats. Urban ponds have an important role in the ecology of urban areas, as they provide essential habitats for aquatic species. The objective of this study is to demonstrate ecological engineering approaches to restoring aquatic biological communities in an urban pond ecosystem, which can be used to achieve water purification of such ecosystems globally. The general approach of first cleaning out the ponds and then systematically applying different treatments of plants and fish was designed and implemented in the field. We used three replicated ponds per engineering treatment to determine which of the treatments was the best option based on an assessment of water quality and biological indicators. The main findings of this study were as follows: a combination of aquatic animals and aquatic plants can provide the best water purification performance; furthermore, macrobenthos, such as Bellamya purificata, can be used as biological indicator species for monitoring dominant species and water quality in a local urban pond ecosystem. In conclusion, maintaining biological species diversity over different trophic levels can provide the best water purification performance in urban pond ecosystems."

The Loss of Landscape Ecological Functionality in the Barcelona Province (1956–2009): Could Land-Use History Involve a Legacy for Current Biodiversity?,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d0ef6a15cf02d33a2609991a263c395705aacce,E. Tello; J. Marull; R. Padró; Claudio Cattaneo; Francesc Coll,"Could past land uses, and the land cover changes carried out, affect the current landscape capacity to maintain biodiversity? If so, knowledge of historical landscapes and their socio-ecological transitions would be useful for sustainable land use planning. We constructed a GIS dataset in 10 × 10 km UTM cells of the province of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) for 1956 and 2009 with the changing levels of farming disturbance exerted through the human appropriation of photosynthetic net primary production (HANPP), and a set of landscape ecology metrics to assess the impacts of the corresponding land-use changes. Then, we correlated them with the spatial distribution of total species richness (including vascular plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals). The results allow us to characterize the main trends in changing landscape patterns and processes, and explore whether a land-use legacy of many complex agroforest mosaics maintained by the intermediate farming disturbance managed in 1956 could still exist, despite the decrease or disappearance of those mosaics before 2009 due to the combined impacts of agroindustrial intensification (meaning higher HANPP levels), forest transition (meaning lower HANPP levels) and urban sprawl. Statistical analysis reveals a positive impact of the number of larger, less disturbed forest patches, where many protected natural sites have been created in 1956–2009. However, it also confirms that this result has not only been driven by conservation policies and that the distribution of species richness is currently correlated with the maintenance of intermediate levels of HANPP. This suggests that both land-sharing and land-sparing approaches to biodiversity conservation may have played a synergistic role owing to the legacy of complex land cover mosaics of former agricultural landscapes that are now under a serious threat."

 Rapid urbanization and the global loss of biodiversity necessitate the development of a research agenda that addresses knowledge gaps in urban ecology that will inform policy, management, and conservation. To advance this goal, we present six topics to pursue in urban biodiversity research: the socioeconomic and social–ecological drivers of biodiversity loss versus gain of biodiversity; the response of biodiversity to technological change; biodiversity–ecosystem service relationships; urban areas as refugia for biodiversity; spatiotemporal dynamics of species, community changes, and underlying processes; and ecological networks. We discuss overarching considerations and offer a set of questions to inspire and support urban biodiversity research. In parallel, we advocate for communication and collaboration across many fields and disciplines in order to build capacity for urban biodiversity research, education, and practice. Taken together we note that urban areas will play an important role in addressing the global extinction crisis."

Mapping surface water quality in Myanmar using aquatic drones,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d53959e1c0f61faf75542f86860d2be5e9e8128,R. Pedroso de Lima; T. Bogaard; Robbert De Lange,"<p>Water resources in Myanmar are increasingly affected by anthropogenic pressure and climate change related impacts. At the Inle Lake a unique village is located on the water in close proximity to intense fishing/farming activities. The nearby floating gardens provide invaluable resources for local communities, who are highly vulnerable to changes to water quality in the lake. Diversely, within the city of Yangon, the Kandawgyi lake is a popular recreational area which has become heavily affected by excessive algae proliferation. The deterioration of water quality Is likely caused by uncontrolled untreated wastewater, and poses a risk to the citizens. Finally, rivers such as the Pan Hlaing River, flow through industrial zones and collect waste water discharges.</p><p>Monitoring in these regions is scarce and limited to a few point-sampling locations. Local stakeholders lack adequate tools to monitor the needed parameters and are in need of reliable and updated baseline water quality data to support them in setting-up sustainable water management strategies. Tools such as aquatic drones and in-situ sensors are innovative ways of monitoring water quality and ecology that could contribute for effectively gathering valuable environmental data.</p><p>In this project, aquatic drones (both underwater and surface) were equipped with water quality sensors and cameras for low-cost and rapid assessment of surface water quality at high spatial resolution. The drones are able to navigate autonomously through way-points while collecting geo-referenced data. This study aims at field-testing of two affordable aquatic drones with sensors to map water quality parameters in different types of water systems (large lake, urban lake, river). This study reports the challenges encountered, and evaluates the resulting dataset/maps are in relation to the cost and value for the local stakeholders (ongoing research).</p><p>At the Inle Lake, results show varying concentrations of the different parameters that were measured. Low dissolved oxygen levels were found within the villages and underneath floating gardens, while chlorophyll-a and cyanobacteria levels were low across the whole lake. Underwater images show the presence of fish and provide insights into the aquatic ecosystems. At the Kandawgyi Lake, the generated water quality maps illustrate the spatial distribution of the different parameters, and two main areas of contamination could be identified (high algae content, low dissolved oxygen, high E-coli concentrations). At the Pan Hlaing river, the plotted data show degrading levels of dissolved oxygen concentrations, indicating potential effects caused by industry outlets.</p><p>The water quality maps that were generated with this data are very illustrative of the condition of the water bodies and the location of contaminations hotspots. The measurement process was accompanied by stakeholders and local universities, which contributed to stimulate capacity building and to create awareness for water quality related problems. As follow-up activities, these results will be used to draft a long-term water quality monitoring plan for local Myanmar students to continue collecting water quality data at these lakes. The detected issues are being discussed with local stakeholders, as well as the possibilities for establishing a larger scale monitoring campaign using this type of monitoring tools.</p>"
Navigating Dementia: Political Materialities of Public Transport in the All‐Ageing Metropolis,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d597a31171259b8aaba4e1b06b8d29d29b02f73,J. Fletcher,"ABSTRACT Age‐ and dementia‐friendliness are major areas of contemporary urban policy and scholarship, seeking to maintain older people and those with cognitive impairment in their own homes and communities. Such work relies on architectural augmentation to maximise the functionality of ageing bodies and minds and has been criticised for conceptualising place as a static unidirectional determinant of individual disability. New materialist scholarship on place, ageing and disability is challenging such conceptions, theorising people and places as dynamically co‐constituting socio‐material ecologies that co‐age and co‐dis/enable. Moreover, a critical tradition is resituating dementia‐friendliness in the materialising capacities of political economy in everyday public living with dementia. Building on that work, this paper reports on a yearlong creative go‐along ethnography conducted with eight passengers with dementia on public transport in Greater Manchester, UK. Through interviewing, multimedia generation and map‐making, their stories highlight unequal materialisations of (im)mobilities in relation to the fractious political economies of urban infrastructures in the all‐ageing metropolis."

Hou; Y. Murayama; Ahmed Derdouri,"Rapid urbanization is one of the most concerning issues in the 21st century because of its significant impacts on various fields, including agriculture, forestry, ecology, and climate. The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, highly related to the rapid urbanization, has attracted considerable attention from both academic scholars and governmental policymakers because of its direct influence on citizens’ daily life. Land surface temperature (LST) is a widely used indicator to assess the intensity of UHI significantly affected by the local land use/cover (LULC). In this study, we used the Landsat time-series data to derive the LULC composition and LST distribution maps of Nanjing in 2000, 2014, and 2018. A correlation analysis was carried out to check the relationship between LST and the density of each class of LULC. We found out that cropland and forest in Nanjing are helping to cool the city with different degrees of cooling effects depending on the location and LULC composition. Then, a Cellar Automata (CA)-Markov model was applied to predict the LULC conditions of Nanjing in 2030 and 2050. Based on the simulated LULC maps and the relationship between LST and LULC, we delineated high- and moderate-LST related risk areas in the city of Nanjing. Our findings are valuable for the local government to reorganize the future development zones in a way to control the urban climate environment and to keep a healthy social life within the city."
Ecological city concept: Challenge and future research agenda in urban ecology perspective,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d6f1e52647c1e7aee3fe68bff7fa25db9bbee93,Enni Lindia Mayona; Ridwan Sutriadi,"Cities are no longer viewed as creatures with a linear-climax-established cycle but as ecosystems with dynamic and complicated processes, with people as the primary component. Thus, we must understand urban ecology’s structure and function to create urban planning and appreciate the mechanisms, dynamics, and evolution that connect human and ecological processes. The ecological city (ecocity) is one of the city conceptions that has evolved with the perspective of urban ecology history. The concept of ecocity development within urban ecology systems pertains to recognizing cities as complex ecosystems primarily influenced by human activities. In this context, individuals actively engage in dynamic problem-solving approaches to address environmental challenges to ensure a sustainable and satisfactory quality of life for future generations. Therefore, it is necessary to study how ecocity has developed since it was initiated today and how it relates to the urban ecology perspective. This study aims to investigate the progression of scholarly publications on ecocity research from 1980 to 2023. Additionally, it intends to ascertain the trajectory of ecological city research trends, establish connections between scientific concepts, and construct an ecological city science network using keyword co-occurrence analysis from the urban ecology perspective. The present study used a descriptive bibliometric analysis and literature review methodology. The data was obtained by utilizing the Lens.org database, was conducted using the VOS (Visualization of Similarities) viewer software for data analysis. The urban ecology research area ecology of cities can be studied further from density visualization of ecosystem services and life cycle assessment. Finally, the challenges and future agenda of ecocity research include addressing humans by modeling functions or processes that connect humans with ecosystems (ecology of cities), urban design, ecological imperatives, integration research, and improving the contribution to environmental goals, spatial distribution, agriculture, natural resources, policy, economic development, and public health."
Urban biogeography of fungal endophytes across San Francisco,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d7e3f3bd0d1a957d02854c55def15fd318c4846,Emma S. Gibson; Naupaka B. Zimmerman,"In natural and agricultural systems, the plant microbiome–the microbial organisms associated with plant tissues and rhizosphere soils–has been shown to have important effects on host physiology and ecology, yet we know little about how these plant-microbe relationships play out in urban environments. Here we characterize the composition of fungal communities associated with living leaves of one of the most common sidewalk trees in the city of San Francisco, California. We focus our efforts on endophytic fungi (asymptomatic microfungi that live inside healthy leaves), which have been shown in other systems to have large ecological effects on the health of their plant hosts. Specifically, we characterized the foliar fungal microbiome of Metrosideros excelsa (Myrtaceae) trees growing in a variety of urban environmental conditions. We used high-throughput culturing, PCR, and Sanger sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS nrDNA) region to quantify the composition and structure of fungal communities growing within healthy leaves of 30 M. excelsa trees from six distinct sites, which were selected to capture the range of environmental conditions found within city limits. Sequencing resulted in 854 high-quality ITS sequences. These sequences clustered into 85 Operational Taxonomic Units (97% OTUs). We found that these communities encompass relatively high alpha (within) and beta (between-site) diversity. Because the communities are all from the same host tree species, and located in relatively close geographical proximity to one another, these analyses suggest that urban environmental factors such as heat islands or differences in vegetation or traffic density (and associated air quality) may potentially be influencing the composition of these fungal communities. These biogeographic patterns provide evidence that plant microbiomes in urban environments can be as dynamic and complex as their natural counterparts. As human populations continue to transition out of rural areas and into cities, understanding the factors that shape environmental microbial communities in urban ecosystems stands to become increasingly important."
El derecho humano al agua en España en el contexto europeo (2010-2020). Implicaciones para las políticas y los modelos de gestión del ciclo urbano,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d8400460b8e9e78ae704f8a18a0e84995a1d013,Á. García; Leandro del Moral Ituarte,"Until very recently, in the debates on water in the Spanish and European context, the concept of the Human Right to Water and Sanitation (HRWS) evoked foreign realities, typical of Latin American countries or other regions of the global south. However, since the beginning of the Great Recession in 2008, as a result of the consequent emergence of situations of poverty and precariousness, the concern to defend the recognition and implementation of this right became present. The declaration of the HRWS by the United Nations in 2010 (United Nations 2010a,2010b), coinciding with this historical juncture, has promoted processes and debates around its effective implementation at an international, European and Spanish level. The current health crisis and the consequent economic debacle caused by the COVID-19 at the beginning of 2020 have updated the urgency of the debate on the HRWS.
In 2015, the plenary session of the European Parliament supported the citizens' initiative Right2Water, which sought to guarantee the right to water for all people and the transposition of the HRWS into the legislation of member states. The current reform process of the Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC) is justified, among other reasons, by the need to adapt these regulations to the aforementioned commitment to coherence. The Right2Water initiative was transferred to Spain, mainly thanks to the encouragement of the Association of Public Water Supply and Sanitation Operators (Asociacion de Operadores Publicos de Abastecimiento y Saneamiento Agua, AEOPAS), within the framework of the statewide Public Water Network (Red Agua Publica, RAP), through the Social Pact for Public Water (Pacto Social por el Agua Publica, PSAP).
The effects of the crisis also coincided with privatization processes of water services that, justified by austerity policies, European institutions promoted in the countries most affected by the crisis, despite strong social opposition. In some of these countries, such as Spain, the process of privatization has been especially related to the seek of funding by municipalities in crisis, through the perverse mechanism of the ‘concession fee’, which allows for a rapid injection of money into the municipal treasury in exchange for a decades-long privatization of the service. This process is usually accompanied by increasing rates and greater pressure on users with payment problems. The relations between the causes and consequences of the crisis and privatization, as well as the emergence of situations of water poverty of different types, have led to the present existence of a social movement, with a solid discourse that is committed to defending the human right to water, as well as the model of public management, in our cities.
At the same time, the existence of public water management companies, which formally maintain public ownership of the service but practice a mercantile management style (priority of profit and loss accounts, opacity, consideration of users as clients) has led to demands to renew public management models to guarantee compliance with the human right to water in a broad and deep sense, redefined in an antagonistic way: a recognition of access to drinking water and sanitation as a human right rigorously conceived that puts into question the neoliberal logic of managing water services.
This is one of the core arguments this article addresses: the HRWS today constitutes the banner of a movement that is articulated around the concept of water as a common good and that is oriented towards the objective of building a collaborative and transparent model of public management. The ownership of water and sanitation services operators (in their different modalities, from strictly public to strictly private formulas) is related to the implementation of the HRWS, which contributes to the reactivation of debates on the need to preserve or recover (‘remunicipalizacion’) the public character of these services, and with the need to generate legal frameworks that guarantee effective local democratic policies. To this social dimension, committed to the public and democratic dimension, open to new debates on common goods management, another characteristic is added: the human rights movement in Spain has been in tune from its beginnings in discourse and organizational structure with socio-eco-integrating perspectives of natural resources, aquatic ecosystems management, which is at the foundation of the possibility of implementing the human right to water. This is a relevant and somewhat distinctive quality of the Spanish experience, which contrasts with the unfortunate, although historically explainable, disagreements and conflicts that frequently characterize the social and environmental perspectives in the movements in defense of water.
In addition to the above, this article presents a new approach to the typology of water poverties. Until recently, the efforts that have been carried out in the implementation of the HRWS have been focused especially on accessibility, condemning and trying to alleviate the deficits in supply and sanitation coverage in the Global South. In contrast, its recent reception in European countries has focused especially on affordability (prohibition of cuts, guarantee of a vital minimum, social rates) and on implications for governance (transparency, accountability) and the management model (public versus private). However, throughout this research it has been found that accessibility remains a significant problem in certain European regions, especially related to the existence of marginal settlements, slums, homelessness, temporary immigrant workers in rural areas, etc. The problem of HRWS is thus situated in the broader context of access to housing and dignified living conditions, and is related to the marginalization and exclusion of groups or social sectors, due to various factors, generally combined, of economic, cultural and/or ethnic nature.
Finally, another issue that this article addresses is the question of the legal regulation of the human right to water in Spain. It will seem strange to a non-expert observer of this matter that after the intense concern, organization and reflection on the subjects that have been mentioned, and which are presented in detail below, and in a country with such a long tradition of water policy and legislation as Spain, we lack a state or autonomic-wide regulatory framework for the management of urban water. And not only do we still lack this or these framework(s) but we have been discussing their need for many years (the jurisdictions and responsibilities over the urban cycle are municipal) and, if they are really needed, their nature, contents and scale of formulation. The article analyzes the keys to this process and ends by presenting the latest propositions on this subject from the HRWS social movement in which its authors are conceptually situated.
From a theoretical (urban political ecology) and methodological (transdisciplinary participatory research-action) point of view, the article has been developed in the double framework in which the authors operate. On the one hand, the working group on the urban water cycle of the New Water Culture Foundation (Fundacion Nueva Cultura del Agua) and, on the other, the Research Networks of Excellence of the National Research Agency on water poverty (WAPONET, CSO2017-90702-REDT), made up of researchers from seven Spanish universities (Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona, Politecnica de Catalunya, Oberta de Catalunya, Jaume I de Castellon, Alicante, Oviedo, Granada y Sevilla). As a space for transdisciplinary action-participation on which this work has been specifically based, mention should be made of the Andalusian Social Committee on Water (Mesa Social del Agua de Andalucia), whose composition and main activities between 2017 and 2020 are reflected throughout these pages. We owe information, ideas and experiences to all the colleagues who participate in these spaces, where we carried out a real process of co-production of knowledge, throughout years of work in common."
The Implications of the New Geography Framework of Urban Agro Ecology on Urban Planning,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2dacf8dd64b71fe9f195a9b5bf456523a7060b57,J. Vargas-Hérnandez,"This paper has the objective to analyze the implications that the new geography framework of urban agro ecology has on urban planning. It departs from the assumption that the new geography is a theoretical framework for the for the analysis of the economic, social, political, ecological, technological, research, and science based on the interrelationships between urban agro ecology and urban planning. The methodology is based in a constructive analysis of the reviewed theoretical and empirical literature to infer a model based on the construct of the new geography. Finally, it is concluded that urban planning of local governments can formulate and implement strategies based on the new geography framework in urban agro ecology to proving incentives in new urban developments and to benefit disadvantaged communities."
"On the Fact of Discovery and Seizure of Steppe Eagle Nestlings at Customs in Saratov Region, Russia",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2db26d8853040fd779f9a46a5cb1e3073d5032c4,G.F. Suleymanova,"Steppe Eagle (Aquila nipalensis) is a rare bird inhabiting wide open areas. The species listed in the Red Book of the Saratov region as small-numbered, depressed category with a slow population decline. The species is included in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation (Bragin, Belik, 2021), Appendix 2 of CITES, Appendix 2 of the Berne Convention, Appendix 2 of the Bonn Convention. Currently, Steppe Eagle is encountered in the southeastern part of the Saratov region, in the Saratov Transvolga. Previously, scientists noted that the northwestern border of the species’ range is gradually moving towards Kazakhstan (Galushin, 2001). Three Steppe Eagle nestlings were seized at border control in Urban-type settlement Ozinki in the Saratov region, on the Russian border with Kazakhstan. The species of seized nestlings was determined after consultation with the staff of the Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution of the RAS (Saratov). Institute staff recommended to transfer nestlings to the Khvalynsky National Park, and border service employees in the Saratov region delivered nestlings there on June 1, 2023. During an external examination, veterinarian determined that nestlings’ appearance was satisfactory, they could not fly, had moderate appetite, were weakened and needed veterinary care. Nestlings’ age estimated at the first month, sexes were not determined. During June 1–22, 2023, nestlings were fed and rehabilitated under the supervision of employees of the Teremok aviary farm of the Khvalynsky National Park. Fresh beef and water four times a day constituted their diet. Their bodies grew, and nestlings developed contour feathers (Fig. 1). However, on July 22, 2023, one nestling died and was removed from the enclosure to avoid the spread of infection to living nestlings. After an examination by an ornithologist, it was decided to send the biomaterial of the deceased nestling to the Federal State-Financed Institution “All-Russian Research Institute for Animal Protection” (Saratov branch) to clarify the cause of death. The autopsy report No. Sar23.P-1984 dated 07.07.2023 and bacteriological examination indicate that nestling died from acute heart failure (aerosacculitis, pericarditis) due to colibacillosis. The causative agent of colibacillosis, E. coli, was isolated from the nestling’s body. The above indicates the vulnerability of Steppe Eagle nestlings at the age of one month. It is necessary to develop standards for keeping these birds in captivity in the future. In nature, particularly strict rules and protective measures should be introduced in pre-nesting and nesting periods of eagles’ development. Employees of ecological education should teach local residents and students about the importance of preserving biodiversity and specifically about Steppe Eagle conservation."
"Water Cycle Health Assessment Using the Combined Weights and Relative Preference Relationship VIKOR Model: A Case Study in the Zheng-Bian-Luo Region, Henan Province",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2db6837da6517592a10c7f8cf5ffaefbf47df4f1,Mengdie Zhao; Jinhai Wei; Yuping Han; Jinhang Li,"Both the natural and social water cycles form part of the regional water cycle, and the assessment of the health of the social water cycle provides useful recommendations for resource allocation, urban planning, and development. The Zheng-Bian-Luo region (Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Luoyang city cluster in China) is used as an example in this study. The three-level “goal criterion index” is used to develop a water cycle index system based on deeper knowledge of the notion of the social water cycle. The system has four criterion layers that measure water quantity, utility, quality, and ecology, in addition to 22 index levels regarding the total water resources and drinking water compliance rate. By using this as a foundation, the minimum information entropy principle was applied to couple AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and EFAST (Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Analysis) in order to calculate the comprehensive weights of the evaluation indicators and build a VIKOR (Intuitionistic Fuzzy Multi-attribute Decision Making Method) model of the relative preference relationship of the fused weights. This model was then compared to the conventional VIKOR model and the FCE (Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Method) method in order to reflect on the objectivity of the evaluation results. The primary barriers preventing the improvement of water cycle health in the Zheng-Bian-Luo region were determined in this study by using the barrier degree model. The findings demonstrate that over the past 11 years, the overall water cycle health in the Zheng-Bian-Luo region has developed toward a healthy trend and that the water cycle health level in the region has gradually improved from the initial sub-pathological state to a healthy state. The results also demonstrate compliance with domestic drinking water sources, comprehensive water consumption per capita, the water consumption of CNY 10,000 of industrial-added value, the water consumption of CNY 10,000 of GDP, and the water consumption of CNY 10,000 for water. The primary barrier to the Zheng-Bian-Luo region’s improvement in water health is the water consumption ratio. The findings of this study can serve as a scientific foundation for creating a balanced urban water cycle and achieving long-term development in the area."
Intelligent Low-Carbon Emission Design Concept for Industrial Cities Driven by Artificial Intelligence,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2df753796e83af01aade2efbe6fd4e1ce3c3cc58,Jinpeng Guo; Ting Xu,"The planning and technology used in modern cities are highly correlated with urban carbon emissions. As the concentration of population, logistics, transportation and industry, cities have become the main concentration of modern energy consumption. Carbon emissions mainly come from industry, transportation, construction and other industries. Recently, artificial intelligence technology has been gradually used in mechatronics engineering, where it can comprehensively solve the shortcomings in traditional mechatronics engineering. This enables artificial intelligence technology to promote the development of mechatronics engineering towards information and intelligence to a certain extent, and contribute to the carbon emissions of industrial cities. When conducting research on low-carbon cities, the problems from people's conventional life style and economic model should be taken into consideration to promote the improvement of low-carbon life quality. While protecting the ecology, the economic development should be promoted and it should perform a good job in urban construction."
The relation between biodiversity in literature and social and spatial situation of authors: Reflections on the nature–culture entanglement,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e060e2869e5216482906f80b6081296372916ff,Lars Langer; Manuel Burghardt; Roland Borgards; R. Richter; C. Wirth,"


Understanding the nature–culture entanglement by combining the methods of natural sciences and humanities is little approached in neither of the fields. With a specific combination of methods from both digital humanities and ecology, we aimed at identifying several of people's life circumstances that relate to their individual sensitivity towards biodiversity. The circumstances with a strong correlation could be considered and targeted by decision‐makers, for example by developing specific education programmes for making people more eco‐conscious or adjusting relevant regulations.

We applied machine learning techniques onto a database including information about the frequency of biodiversity mentioned in creative literature (BiL) from 1705 to 1969 as response variable related to metadata about the corresponding works and their authors as predictors, including localisation, age, gender and literature genre. The algorithm determined the response's dependency on each predictor, which can be interpreted as the intensity of this particular sensitivity parameter for biodiversity, and which we also related to time.

We recognised that gender, age, region and settlement size are predictors significantly correlated to BiL. Statistically, these predictors can be viewed as starting points of the eventual individual level of awareness for biodiversity. For example, authors from villages exhibit a higher BiL than those from cities, which we interpret as a signal for the dependence of awareness for biodiversity on spatial distance from nature, which in turn can be addressed in urban development.

Our conclusion is that applying a machine learning technique on literary data yields meaningful results, thereby showing potential for further similar investigations and the combination of methods from natural sciences and humanities to achieve so far unattainable insights.

THE CONCEPT OF THE SMART CITY AS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO RESTORE THE URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE OF UKRAINE DURING THE POST-WAR PERIOD,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e061bb9db9929a608ec134e2e8abd2062768b67,O. Zakharova; Dmytro Kozyriev,"Modern information technologies in the world are developing at a very fast pace and gradually cover all spheres of human life. This greatly facilitates and improves a person's life, fills it with new meaning. This is how smart cities are built in developed countries. These are approaches to the management of urban infrastructure, where innovations and breakthrough information technologies allow citizens not only to use resources economically, but also to actively participate in the life and development of their own city. This allows to form a strategy for a successful and competitive future of the city. To date, the concept of a smart city for Ukraine is not the most relevant due to the fact that the country is in the active phase of the war. However, in order to speed up the country's recovery processes in the post-war period, one should reasonably approach the choice of the development strategy that will become the basis for restoring the Ukrainian economy in the near future. A deeper study of the essence of the concept of a smart city has led to the conclusion that this approach can be saving for the weakened economy of Ukraine and create conditions for its future rapid development. 
The paper considers the content of the concept of a smart city and its evolution over time. It has been established that the main components of the successful implementation of the concept of a smart city are the economy, mobility, environment, human capital, life potential and management. The essence of each of the six selected components is detailed. Based on a study of the goals, content and best practices for implementing the concept of a smart city within such developed cities of the world as New York, Amsterdam, Barcelona and Shanghai, the features of the functioning of successful smart cities in the world are determined. The most successful smart city projects are given, which can become guidelines for the restoration of Ukrainian cities. Taking into account the current global trends in the construction of smart cities and taking into account the Ukrainian geopolitical specifics, the key directions for the restoration of Ukrainian cities in the post-war period are formulated. These areas include security, infrastructure, mobility, healthy life, information and ecology."
"‘I know how to live from what the hill gives’: biocultural uses, tensions and partial reconstructions around the common goods of the Cerro Caracol urban park",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e066cbc3ef99d35260e64fb8eba70725089a516,Beatriz E Cid-Aguayo; Verónica Oliveros; Diego Oñate Vargas; Anah'i Gajardo; Graciela Silva; Joaquín Pinela; Pablo Vejar,"
 In the south-central Chilean city of Concepción, an irregular urban settlement named ‘Agüita de la Perdiz’ (Partridge Creek) built on the slopes of Cerro Caracol (Snail Hill) has become an emblematic neighbourhood, located within an urban biodiversity hotspot. The richness and biodiversity of the landscape have been used in different ways by the inhabitants of Concepción, but in the case of the Agüita de la Perdiz residents, it is also part of their way of life, representing an unusual people–nature relationship in urban spaces. We analyze the relationship between the community and the hill, with its forest, fauna, waters and recreational areas; the successive territorial dispossessions and the various conflicts involved in the operation of the Metropolitan Park, created to protect the hill; and the efforts led by community members to recompose their relationship with the hill. The case problematizes urban bioculture, from a political ecology of commons perspective, and co-management approaches for conservation."
We want you! Recruitment strategies for the success of a citizen science project on urban wildlife ecology,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e19a660d33bf20f22c13470cc80ecbda26e2e81,A. Schumann; H. Greving; Till Bruckermann; Joachim Kimmerle; Ute Harms; Miriam Brandt,"In this case study, we report on the recruitment of participants for a citizen science (CS) project on urban wildlife monitoring (about 860 participants), and the consequences of recruitment strategies for achieving the project goals. We describe the approach that we used to identify our target audience and to design the core message for the recruitment campaign. We searched for participants who were interested in wildlife and in the scientific research process. We based the recruitment campaign on the appeal of discovering wildlife in people’s immediate surroundings. Recruitment was successful in terms of the number of applications we received. Participants’ interests reflected their focus on wildlife, and we discuss how this was reflected in their engagement. We use this case study to highlight the importance of deliberately designing recruitment strategies for CS projects. Such strategies will have implications for participants’ motivation and ultimately may influence their contributions to the project."
Update to Floral Diversity at Gujarat Institute of Desert Ecology (GUIDE) Campus Along with New Distribution of Salsola Oppositifolia Desf. in Kachchh,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e1b3403950a92a7671726c8bdbbe37db8068939,Rakesh A. Poptani; Bhagirath R. Paradva; Jayesh B. Bhatt; Vivek U. Chauhan,"This study explores the biodiversity dynamics within the prestigious Gujarat Institute of Desert Ecology (GUIDE) campus in Bhuj, India, over the span of eight years. Fieldwork conducted during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods revealed a significant increase in plant species, genera, and families compared to previous assessments. The taxonomic diversity analysis revealed 239 plant species representing 180 genera and 62 families, with trees, herbs, and shrubs contributing prominently. Fabaceae appeared as the dominant family, followed by Poaceae and Malvaceae. Comparative analysis with previous studies established changes in species composition, notably an increase in tree species and a decrease in herbs. Of particular interest is the discovery of the second distribution of Salsola oppositifolia Desf. on the campus, a plant species first recorded in India in 2022 from Great Rann of Kachchh. The study highlights the crucial role of urban green spaces in supporting biodiversity. With 239 plant species thriving within the campus's urban infrastructure, this study highlights the potential of urban forestry in promotion biodiversity conservation and ecological resilience. Future research directions include exploring the ecological roles of vegetation and development public awareness about the multi-layered benefits of plants beyond oxygen production."
Effects of Underwater Ship Sound and Urban Noise on Voluntary Feeding and Growth Response of Fish,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e2a06c22fab506ea0c3de2b8e1c9a1aa4c2dc8a,Halit Kuşku,"
 The drastically increase of human population and urbanization in waterfronts has boosted the shipping industry along the coast line of urbanized areas. In the present study, impacts of rising noise pollution in coastal areas due to intense urbanization at waterfronts and ship sound from harbors on possible acclimation response of fish through the assessment of voluntary feeding and growth performance have been evaluated. During the initial 15-days of sound exposure, fish growth was almost stable with a linear growth trend. However, an increasing trend was noted from day-30 onwards over the following 60 days until the end of the study (day-90), which could be linked to a time-dependent acclimation of fish to ship sound and urban noise. A remarkable shift towards a significant increase in growth after the first 15-days of slow-growth trend in fish exposed to underwater sound transmissions presented evidence for a “catch-up growth endeavor”, that resulted in an increased voluntary feeding, indicating that nearshore populations of fish near harbors, ferry ports and noisy intense urban waterfronts might acclimate to noisy conditions over a certain time, which was found as 15-30 days under the conditions applied in this study. These findings may support policymakers for environmental management towards an ecology-based planning of near-shore industrial development."
Impact of joint interactions with humans and social interactions with conspecifics on the risk of zooanthroponotic outbreaks among wildlife populations,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e3873ef6a0d87016b43689af7e753ac907e988e,K. Balasubramaniam; Nalina Aiempichitkijkarn; S. Kaburu; P. Marty; B. Beisner; E. Bliss-Moreau; Małgorzata E. Arlet; E. Atwill; B. McCowan,"Pandemics caused by pathogens that originate in wildlife highlight the importance of understanding the behavioral ecology of disease outbreaks at human–wildlife interfaces. Specifically, the relative effects of human–wildlife and wildlife-wildlife interactions on disease outbreaks among wildlife populations in urban and peri-urban environments remain unclear. We used social network analysis and epidemiological Susceptible-Infected-Recovered models to simulate zooanthroponotic outbreaks, through wild animals’ joint propensities to co-interact with humans, and their social grooming of conspecifics. On 10 groups of macaques (Macaca spp.) in peri-urban environments in Asia, we collected behavioral data using event sampling of human–macaque interactions within the same time and space, and focal sampling of macaques’ social interactions with conspecifics and overall anthropogenic exposure. Model-predicted outbreak sizes were related to structural features of macaques’ networks. For all three species, and for both anthropogenic (co-interactions) and social (grooming) contexts, outbreak sizes were positively correlated to the network centrality of first-infected macaques. Across host species and contexts, the above effects were stronger through macaques’ human co-interaction networks than through their grooming networks, particularly for rhesus and bonnet macaques. Long-tailed macaques appeared to show intraspecific variation in these effects. Our findings suggest that among wildlife in anthropogenically-impacted environments, the structure of their aggregations around anthropogenic factors makes them more vulnerable to zooanthroponotic outbreaks than their social structure. The global features of these networks that influence disease outbreaks, and their underlying socio-ecological covariates, need further investigation. Animals that consistently interact with both humans and their conspecifics are important targets for disease control."
EVALUATING THE PATTERN OF LOW-INCOME HOUSING IN NEW CITIES ACCORDING TO URBAN ECOLOGY CRITERIA,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e38a5435eca39a00eccb0748d1af635274624e2,Seham A Mohamed Hasan; Fouad M. Fouad; Mohamed A. Soliman,"The study seeks to evaluate the pattern of low-income housing in new cities according to the standards of urban ecology, by relying on the inductive and analytical approach in dealing with the concepts of urban ecology and its factors influencing the direction of the housing pattern and determining the dimensions and standards that suit the Egyptian situation, as the study relied on ecological factors. Which is based on the relationship between humans and the built environment in general and the residential environment in particular, The deductive analytical approach in analyzing low-income housing projects and programs proposed by the Egyptian state since 1952 until now, and comparing them to regional and global experiences that adopted the ideology of urban ecology, with the aim of evaluating the Egyptian experience and clarifying whether it has achieved its goal of meeting the needs of its residents qualitatively and not quantitatively in light of Study of urban ecology and its relationship with various factors of urban development."
Artificial Neural Network-Based Planting Arrangement of Smart City in Green Ecological Environment,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e3f662073ca0f3812d4869341bf605a7365be99,Qingsong Meng; Shu-feng Wang,"The traditional urban planting arrangement is largely limited by the designer’s idea and has a high repetition rate and a low reference reuse rate. Therefore, a scientific and reasonable planting arrangement of the urban environment is necessary. In this work, research on planting arrangements in a smart city is carried out under green ecology and environment. Firstly, the planting arrangement is analyzed based on the structure, characteristics, and basic principles of the artificial neural network (ANN) model. ANN is frequently applied in pattern recognition, signal processing, system identification, and optimization. In the field of control, neural networks are used to deal with the nonlinearity and uncertainty of the control system and to approximate the identification function of the system. Secondly, the output value of the planting arrangement in the smart city is calculated according to the error backpropagation algorithm. During this period, the weight is adjusted according to the Hebb criterion, and the relevant statistical model of planting arrangement in the smart city is analyzed by ANN. Finally, suggestions on planting arrangements are given. The research shows that steamed bun-shaped plants have the largest total number in smart cities, followed by spherical and bush-like plants. Planting arrangement for spherical and palm or coconut-form plants is more frequent while planting arrangements for wind-shaped plants have a lower frequency. In terms of the importance of the planting arrangement, these 18 types of plants are very important for the green ecological environment in the smart city. Finally, suggestions on planting arrangements are given according to the research."
"Nest site selection, nest characteristics, and breeding ecology of the Eurasian tree sparrow, Passer montanus, living in an urban area",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e3fc3d64036c02ef0546decd557e13e7aaf7b5f,Ju-Hyun Lee; Se-Yeong Kim; Ha-Cheol Sung,"Urbanization has resulted in changes in bird life histories, and some species have successfully adapted to urban environments, resulting in synurbization. Nest site selection in urban areas challenges cavity nesters because natural nest sites are often replaced by artificial holes. This study was conducted to identify the nest site selection and nest characteristics of the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus) living in an urban environment. This species inhabits artificial structures and tree holes around human settlements. We surveyed nests of tree sparrows on the Chonnam National University campus, located in Gwangju, Republic of Korea, during the first clutch from March to May 2020. We categorized nest types into natural and artificial nest sites. The tree sparrows selected natural nest sites such as woodpecker's holes and cracks in trees, and selected artificial nest sites which included holes in concrete buildings, under roofs, and in steel frames and nesting boxes. No significant differences were found in breeding schedules and reproductive success between birds nesting in artificial and natural holes. The results suggest that tree sparrows can successfully adapt to an urban environment by selecting nest sites regardless of nest hole type, and can reproduce successfully when nesting in both natural and artificial holes."
Urban Wetland Restoration Design Based on the Ecological Concepts--Taking Guanyintang Wetland Park in Chongqing as an Example,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e5f296ca287d7af1d6b2d97d7c3863804f6af01,Qing Zhang; Weiran Tian; Ying Huang,"With the improvement of people’s awareness of environmental protection and the pursuit of high standards of living places, there are more thinkings about urban ecological issues. Through the construction of urban wetland parks, it is of great significance to improve the appearance of the city and maintain the urban ecological balance and sustainable ecological development. Taking Guanyintang Wetland Park in Chongqing as an example, low-lying swamps are used to build wetland parks. Guided by ecological theory, make full use of the original site conditions to restore the design of the wetland park, optimize the ecological functions of the area, and increase the recreation of tourists places, elaborately create an urban environment with perfect functions, beautiful ecology, livable and industrial, so as to further enhance the city’s taste."
"Cherry River: Art, Music, and Indigenous Stakeholders of Water Advocacy in Montana",2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e87d2e83da434fb61af1adf501b5805ee1e0e66,J. Davidson,"The 2018 performance event, Cherry River, Where the Rivers Mix, designed by Indigenous scholar, Dr. Shane Doyle, a member of the Apsaalooke Crow community, in collaboration with artist Mary Ellen Strom, a founder of the nonprofit Mountain Time Arts program, endeavored to address the surging environmental problems associated with water in Montana. Drought and water scarcity impacts a diverse population, including Indigenous communities and the life of nonhuman plant and animals beyond the urban and rural populace of landowners, ranchers, and farmers. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared a federal emergency of drought disaster in a majority of Montana’s counties, and the recent disappearance of glaciers at Glacier National Park is of great concern. Doyle and Strom sought the opportunity to foster relationships and greater dialogue among regional constituencies, particularly among Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities, and they were successful in raising awareness regarding the need for equitable water use and conservation. Cherry River brought an audience of local people to the banks of the Missouri River Headwaters, where the Gallatin, the Jefferson, and the Madison rivers converge to present a mix of American music—Crow and Northern Cree singing, Métis violin, Big Band Jazz. The sound of the music of the rivers, however, was the all-encompassing engagement for those who attended. Drought and environmental crisis impels us to think more broadly about the role of the arts and humanities in environmental studies. Can the arts and performance contribute a different model for environmental advocacy, acknowledge a different perspective for understanding ecologies, and therefore expand the transdisciplinary process for engaging in environmental studies?"

The economic development in Northwest China is slow, the ecological environment is fragile, and the mineral resources are rich. Only through green development can we realize the comprehensive income of regional production development, rich life, and good ecology. This paper measures the green development efficiency of 30 prefecture-level cities in Northwest China by using DEA-SBM model of unexpected output, explores the differences and causes of green development efficiency from the perspective of time and space through convergence coefficient, coordination matrix, GIS, and other methods, and empirically tests the impact of industrial structure, technological progress, and other driving factors on green development efficiency by using panel Tobit model. The results show that, on the whole, the efficiency of green development in Northwest China is low, path dependence is serious and unbalanced, the coordinated development effect of different regions is weak, and the spillover effect of core urban agglomerations has not been effectively exerted; from the perspective of driving factors, economic development, population density, traffic situation, and education investment can significantly improve the efficiency of urban green development, and the second is that the proportion of industries significantly hinders the improvement of green development efficiency, while the impact of scientific and technological innovation is not significant. Based on the empirical results, this paper believes that the harmonious development of natural environment and economic society can be realized only by improving the coordinated development effect among cities, implementing the optimization and upgrading of industrial structure, introducing excellent talents, and promoting the technological upgrading."
Satellite Dependency: The Problem of Legitimating Structures for Localized Arts and Cultural Policy,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ea0ad6b28fcd50627adf376ad5218b7360eee34,Claire Burnill-Maier,"Against a backdrop of growing interest in localized cultural policy, this article explores the example of Oldham, an “overshadowed” town (Pike et al., 2016) situated on the edge of the Northern English city of Manchester (United Kingdom). While urban planning discourse has acknowledged the impact of large cities on neighboring satellite areas, finding that regeneration projects can result in a weak sense of place for [such] secondary towns (Turok, 2009), few have considered the extent to which arts organizations in secondary towns are able to sustain their work and create their own narratives. Drawing from the thought of Pierre Bourdieu and from theories of institutional logics, I adopt a relational approach to exploring the ways in which organizations within the local cultural ecology understand their operating environment. Although cultural policy endeavors to use local arts infrastructure to build local capacity, this case study reveals a situation in which those organizations in satellite towns remain unable to gain the status enjoyed by their metropolitan counterparts. Further, it examples a field that remains highly institutionalized, hierarchical, and increasingly professionalized. Institutional arrangements result in organizations in the satellite-town depending upon its city neighbor for crucial legitimating capitals. Just as stories of class reproduce patterns of inequality, this situation is similarly true for organizations. Organizations are found to be complicit in the production and reproduction of inequalities within the institutional field, with dominant organizations appearing more able to access legitimizing capital than others. Ultimately, I argue that organizations in satellite towns are heavily reliant on symbolic resources supplied by the institutional fields of greater scope in which they are nested. Organizations are required to harness the support of elite individuals and dominant “world-maker” organizations, which lie beyond their immediate local context to secure legitimacy for themselves and their activities. This situation I term “satellite dependency.”"

Sustainability lessons in traditional Bengali proverbs,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2eb47e557b0ba2620bf58914b46c05d49efd8ccf,Monalisa Bhattacherjee; Sweta Sinha,"By employing an exploratory sequential mixed method, the present article examined the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and the ecological components of traditional Bengali proverbs (Khanar bacan), which is almost on the verge of extinction. Subsequently, we surveyed the current generation to assess their familiarity with these proverbs and explore connections between their understanding and eco-literacy. Our investigation encompassed 150 ecological proverbs, illustrating an understanding of ecological patterns and sustainability. The qualitative examination of the proverbs revealed the ecological component of scientific understanding of environmental patterns and cosmology. The proverbs are embedded with an ecosophy that appreciates the interconnectedness between the social systems and the surrounding ecology. The survey pointed out that participants whose residences belong to urban areas are not very familiar with the Khanar bacan. In contrast, the rural participants performed better in identifying the proverbs. Notably, the findings also indicated that the participants who were familiar with the proverbs demonstrated accuracy in responding to questions with TEK-based perspectives. The study underscores the efficacy of proverbs in cultivating ecoliteracy among the Bengali folk. Again, it presented a grim picture of the Bengal youth who are obscuring the indigenous knowledge in their minds and are becoming more susceptible to ecological catastrophe. In fact, the well-being of both humans and the environment is interconnected. Therefore, there is a dire need to protect indigenous knowledge because it provides a novel way to reduce the human-nature divide."
"Simulating the Future Land Use and Land Cover by Implementing Machine Learning Knowledge on the South-Western Zone of Rajshahi District, Bangladesh",2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2eca0cfe704351b1d31635b46c30992cf40ad231,Md Nurun Naeem Tasin; Md. Nazmul Haque; M. Saroar,"Urbanization causes major urban pressures and changes in habitat, ecology, and environmental diversity. Particularly in developing countries, they are often characterized with strong urban sprawl. This research aimed to detect the temporal LULC change with the driving forces of LULC and forecast the future LULC via simulation in Rajshahi, Bangladesh. The LULC was classified through supervised classification using Erdas Imagine. To predict future land-use/ land cover change, the Land Change Modeler (LCM) of Terrset application was used with the implementation of CA and Markov chain analysis. “Built-up area” and “bare land” increased whereas “water bodies” and “vegetation” landforms decreased from 1991 to 2011. Although, “builtup area” and “vegetation” increased as “water bodies” and “bare land” decreased from 2001 to 2021. The driving forces of the LULC change were identified through correlation. The conventional driving forces were found to be ‘population,’ ‘literacy rate,’ ‘population density,’ ‘household income’ and ‘average household size’. When the outcome of the coefficient is positive, the driving force works proportionally. Average accuracy of the prediction model is approximately 85% and the predicted image was validated with the classified image of 2021 and the average accuracy was 92.03%. LULC for the years 2001, 2011 and 2021 along with the driving forces served as the basis to predict land-use/land cover for 2031, and 2041. This research helps to analyse urban planning policies and environmental management, and to take proper measure for proper control of LULC change

However, current research in this field still faces challenges due to coarse scale of studies and limited availability of accurate data. Taking Harbin City as a research case, this research employed an improved mutation level method, Pearson correlation analysis, and a multi-scale geographically weighted regression model to comprehensively investigate the profiling of land use multifunctions and their trade-off /synergy relationships. The comparative advantage theory was adopted to identify dominant functional zones using the NRCA index at a grid scale, in order to achieve a territorial spatial functional zoning delineation. The results showed that there were intricate trade-off/synergy relationships among production–living–ecology functions. Moreover, the types and intensity of trade-off/synergy evolved continuously with socio-economic development and regional resource endowment disparities. Due to its exceptional resource endowment, the agricultural dominated, urban dominated, and ecological dominated functional areas accounted for a significant proportion of 29%, 7%, and 26%, respectively. However, owing to the intricate trade-offs/synergies inherent in land use multifunctions, only a mere 2% (agricultural), 1% (urban), and 1% (ecological) of the area were identified as Optimization Guidance Zones. Conversely, Remediation Improvement Zones constituted the largest share at 63% of the total area, with agricultural, urban, and ecological Remediation Improvement Zones accounting for approximately 33%, 12%, and 18%, respectively. Based on the results of the type and intensity of trade-off/synergy among production–living–ecological functions, as well as the dominant zones and the integrated territorial spatial functional zoning delineation, this article provided targeted recommendations for the sustainable development of the region. These recommendations took into account both resource endowment and socio-economic development characteristics specific to the study area. The study aims to contribute to related research gaps, while providing valuable insights for other regional studies."
HOW DATA CENTERS HAVE COME TO MATTER: Governing the Spatial and Environmental Footprint of the ‘Digital Gateway to Europe’,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2efb614ef8fb1247cad36d694f00d10cfce3e2e8,J. Monstadt; Katherine Saltzman,"Data centers, the material backbone of smart cities, power the digital economy and advanced digital services. Metaphors of ‘the cloud’ and ‘cloud computing’ obscure the massive computing and storage infrastructures, the resource flows and the land uses they mediate. To date, smart city research and policies have been concerned less with the materiality of enabling data infrastructures than with the material effects of increased datafication and digitalization of urban services. Only recently has urban data infrastructures’ rapidly expanding spatial and environmental footprint pushed their materialities to the forefront of public and academic controversies. Building on recent research on cloud geographies and ecologies, this article traces the politicization and emerging regulation around data centers in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area, the self‐proclaimed ‘digital gateway to Europe’. Here, after years of unconditional political support and regulatory passivity, a cascade of policy reforms has been introduced to confine data center growth. Nevertheless, severe urban governance challenges remain in mitigating data centers’ massive electricity, resource and land demands, and in exploiting their residual heat. We thus advocate broader dialogue across the affected policy fields and broader publics about which political objectives merit prioritizing given the constraints of available electricity and land."
"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices on camel respiratory diseases and conditions in Garissa and Isiolo, Kenya",2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f035f0a2c93b13fe39cc7761495ba9470fdcccd,J.

Hambe; Thomas M Nyariki; F. Fasina,"Background Livestock farmers' attitudes, practices, and behaviors are major factors in infection prevention and control of animal diseases. Kenya has the fourth largest global camel population, and the industry has grown over the last two decades, transforming beyond the traditional camel-keeping areas to include peri-urban camel trade and value chain growth. The dromedary camel is resilient, and it is a preferred species in the arid and semi-arid areas (ASALs) of Kenya. However, it still faces many health and production challenges; to identify infection drivers and risky behaviors for camel respiratory illnesses and conditions in Kenya, we conducted a knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) survey. Method Using a set of tools (questionnaires, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions), we interviewed camel owners, herders, agro-veterinary outlets, and other relevant value chain stakeholders in Garissa and Isiolo counties (n = 85). Data were analyzed using descriptive and analytic statistics. Results Most camel owners/herders are male and most are relatively uneducated (85.5%). The camels were used primarily for milk and meat production, income generation, and transport. Larger herd sizes (>30 camels) and owner/herder's lack of formal education are risk factors for owner-reported respiratory illnesses in camels. Major clinical signs of respiratory conditions were coughing (85.7%), nasal discharge (59.7%), and fever (23.4%). Diseases, lack of feeds, theft, and marketing challenges are the major constraints to camel production in Kenya. Owners-herders use drugs indiscriminately and this may contribute to antimicrobial resistance challenges. Conclusion Practitioners in the camel value chain want more commitment from the government and animal health officials on support services and access to veterinary services. Watering points, grazing areas, and marketing points are the primary areas for congregating camels and have a significant potential for disease spread. Kenya camels have a massive capacity for rural and ASALs' livelihoods transformation but the identified health challenges, and other issues must be addressed. Further studies on the Kenyan camels' respiratory microbial ecology are important to understand microbial risks and reduce the burden of zoonotic infections. Intensification of risk communication and community engagement, and messaging targeted at behavior change interventions should be directed at camel value chain actors."
"Rooftop gardening complexities in the Global South: Motivations, practices, and politics",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f0926c2968f1c2cc009921ab2d624aa5a4b3433,Sarah Turner; Thi-Thanh-Hiên Pham; Hạnh Thúy Ngô; Celia Zuberec,"An increasing number of urban residents in the Global South are turning to rooftop gardening, whether through soil or hydroponics, to cultivate their own vegetables, fruit, and herbs. In Hanoi, Vietnam’s capital, rooftop gardening serves as an important alternative to traditional wet markets and more recently established supermarkets. In this paper, we examine the motivations, practices, and constraints of Hanoi’s rooftop gardeners, along with the level of government support or disapproval for rooftop gardening. Our study is grounded in critical urban geography and urban political ecology and specific debates regarding informal life politics. Our findings reveal that Hanoi’s rooftop gardeners feel confronted by a critical food safety crisis, emphasising their need to access safe, fresh, and affordable produce through rooftop gardening. Simultaneously, they express scepticism about the capacity and willingness of formal political institutions at both the municipal and national levels to address and resolve these concerns. We explore whether Hanoi’s urban rooftop gardeners can be considered to be engaging in a form of everyday life politics and examine the dynamics emerging in this regard. We conclude by offering potential policy recommendations for Global South cities to support urban gardening communities."
Spatial Transformation Characteristics and Conflict Measurement of Production-Living-Ecology: Evidence from Urban Agglomeration of China,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f118f8a3d1dc14e1083bcda24bad567879b5b83,Yu Chen; X. Su; Xuekai Wang,"The land development by human beings has changed from the initial small-scale and low-level transformation to the comprehensive utilization of large-scale and high-intensity implementations. The contradiction between production-living-ecology space (PLES) has become increasingly prominent while drawing land dividends. As one of the important birthplaces of Chinese civilization and the ecological barrier in the northern region, the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the Yellow River Basin (YRB) make the ecological environment very fragile, and the imbalance of land and space development is extremely serious. Therefore, according to the multifunctional characteristics of land use, this paper establishes a classification system of production space (PS), living space (LS) and ecology space (ES), and discusses the spatiotemporal evolution and conflict distribution characteristics of the PLES with the help of the transfer matrix and spatial conflict index (SCI). The results are as follows. In 1990–2020, agricultural production space (APS), grassland ecology space (GES) and other ecology space (OES) yielded the largest proportion of PLES in the YRB. However, compared with 1990, the area of these spatial types decreased in 2020, while the urban living space (ULS) expanded rapidly. The distribution pattern of PLES was generally consistent, and the transformation between PLES in Ningxia, central Inner Mongolia, Loess Plateau and downstream areas was relatively intense. The conflict index of PLES showed an upward trend, but it was generally in a controllable range. The stable and controllable areas were concentrated in the upstream of the urban agglomeration, and the midstream and downstream were basic out of control and seriously out of control, respectively."
Application of a sustainable destination framework to model Mexican heritage destination resilience in times of crisis,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f1952ce2df7965119ea636ff26f5d501bf44be3,J. Heald,"The article discusses World Heritage Site Guanajuato, Mexico, a mature destination which suffers sustainability issues concerning water provision, traffic congestion, and refuse collection, the result of chaotic urban growth. Stagnating visitor numbers indicates ageing social infrastructure, dated tourism products, and reputational damage of public insecurity. The research objective is to improve municipal planning by using a resilience framework from the tourism ecology literature to encourage sustainable development. It integrates the results of a 2021 survey of local tourism business opinion and finds Guanajuato’s multi-business owners are innovative in crisis, reacting to covid-19 with changes to their products and services. Federal and State government hardly responded. It should widen membership of the municipal Tourist Board and incorporate project evaluators within the local Planning Office to apply a resilience model to address environmental, infrastructural, and tourism challenges."
Multicologies? The development of multi-racial creative ecologies in East London,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f3792ba09e87b48f833f7a5f3cafa42a1aa8072,Orson Nava,"ABSTRACT In post-industrial economies, the creative industries have become major drivers of urban transformation. However, industry reports show that racialised minorities remain underrepresented in the UK’s creative industries. In this context, East London’s growing number of creative-industries hubs run the risk of re-inscribing existing patterns of racial exclusion onto the urban topography. In this article, I utilise analytical models drawn from the study of the creative industries and urban sociology to examine how racialised inequality in the creative sectors can become spatialised in an urban setting. I argue that East London’s regeneration process is largely structured by discourses of institutional ‘diversity’ that have historically failed to deliver greater levels of inclusion in the sphere of creative production. In this context, I point to the need for multicultural creative networks and production hubs, that I term ‘multicologies’, where racialised practitioners from complementary sectors of the creative industries can be spatially concentrated."
Exploring the connection between transdisciplinary co-production and urban sustainability solutions: a case study at an urban stream management symposium,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f45bdadd6b41da648793c1a8c637f1d208dac21,R. P. Bixler; J. A. Belaire; K. Faust; M. Scoggins; Ana M González,"Urban sustainability challenges are complex, impacting a wide range of stakeholders. It is commonly accepted that sustainable solutions must integrate scientific knowledge from a variety of disciplines, coupled with community stakeholder ideas, norms, and practices in ways that link knowledge to decision-making and action. Jointly researching problems and co-designing solutions, known as co-production, requires working together in teams. Interestingly, the intersection of co-production and team science has been understudied. We address this gap by asking: Does team formation – specifically, single-, multi- or trans-disciplinary teams – impact the process and perceived efficacy of sustainability solutions? Using case study data collected at the 5th Symposium for Urbanization and Stream Ecology (SUSE5), held in February 2020, we explore the impact of bringing different types of teams together to generate solutions to real-world “wicked problems” surrounding urban streams in Austin, Texas. We found that the solutions generated by trans-disciplinary teams – i.e., teams that include multiple disciplines and community members – were on average rated higher by their peers than solutions from single- or multi-disciplinary teams. However, our findings suggest that some transdisciplinary teams found it difficult to get through the different stages of problem definition to solution design. The findings from this limited but novel and unique case study make two important contributions to the literature. First, co-production leads to more agreeable solutions to urban sustainability challenges. Second, co-production team dynamics are likely to be more complicated and variable than disciplinary or multidisciplinary teams. A better understanding of these opportunities and challenges can inform institutions and agencies employing a community-engaged process to solve urban sustainability challenges."
Landscape design approaches to enhance human–wildlife interactions in a compact tropical city,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f4ba9119a93d62f67ffe688a8804379ae3fbf64,Yun Hye Hwang; Anuj Jain,"
 Urban landscapes have the potential to conserve wildlife. Despite increasing recognition of this potential, there are few collaborative efforts to integrate ecology and conservation principles into context-dependent, spatial and actionable design strategies. To address this issue and to encourage multi-disciplinary research on urban human–wildlife interactions, we ask the following questions. To what extent should design and planning actions be aligned with urban ecology in the context of a compact city? How can wildlife conservation meet the seemingly conflictual demands of urban development and public preference? To answer these questions, we refer to the relevant literature and a number of design projects. Using the compact tropical city of Singapore as a case study, we propose 12 design strategies. We encourage designers and planners to strengthen the links between wildlife and urban dwellers and promote wildlife conservation within cities."
COMBINATION IMPACT OF pH AND TEMPERATURE ON THE TOXICITY OF LEAD ON ZOOPLANKTON IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL WARMING,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f504378000a9cbfc0b504909a64cae9180da22c,Hoang Thi Thu-Huong; H. T. Pham; C. T. Nguyen; H. Nguyen,"Heavy metal pollution in Hanoi's urban lakes has become one of the significant environmental issues in the last decades. Research on the toxicity of Pb is necessary due to the extent of its harm to aquatic ecosystems. The toxicity of Pb to aquatic organisms (EC50 values) depends on different environmental conditions. The study was conducted to evaluate the effect of temperature on Pb's toxicity on the test organism Moina Dubia. Moina Dubia belonging to the Cladocera group (Cladocera), an indigenous creature collected at Lake Hanoi. Moina Dubia was cultured under laboratory conditions and has been used to conduct EC50 determination for Pb. Moina Dubia grew and developed well in the laboratory and was suitable as a test organism in toxicological studies. A survey from 24 to 28 o C water temperature conditions showed that the EC50 value decreases from 1402 to 775 ug/l. The combination of temperature and pH strongly affects the toxicity of Pb on Moina Dubia. The apparent impact of water temperature and on the toxicity of Pb showed that global warming might gradually lead to potential biodegradation in freshwater ecology."
Spatiotemporal variations of ecosystem services in the Aral Sea basin under different CMIP6 projections,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f7118972a41ca74c05bb4c341a72e881b6782cf,Jing He; Yang Yu; Lingxiao Sun; Chunlan Li; Haiyan Zhang; I. Malik; M. Wistuba; Ruide Yu,"The Aral Sea, located in Central Asia, has undergone significant reduction in surface area owing to the combined impacts of climate change and human activities. This reduction has led to a regional ecological crisis and profound repercussions on ecosystem services. Investigating the spatiotemporal variations and synergistic trade-offs of ESs in the Aral Sea basin is crucial for fostering the integrated development of the region’s socioeconomic ecology. This study utilizes the Future Land-Use Simulation and InVEST models to analyze future land-use scenarios, integrating CMIP6 projections to assess the quality of four key ecosystem services: water production, soil conservation, carbon storage, and habitat quality over two timeframes: the historical period (1995–2020) and the projected future (2021–2100). Employing Spearman correlation, the study explores the trade-offs and synergies among these ecosystem services. Findings reveal that the primary forms of land-use change in the Aral Sea basin are the reduction in water area (− 49.59%) and the rapid expansion of urban areas (+ 504.65%). Temporally, habitat quality exhibits a declining trend, while carbon storage shows an increasing trend, and water production and soil retention fluctuate initially decreasing and then increasing. Spatially, water production and carbon storage demonstrate an increasing trend from the northwest to the southeast. Habitat quality exhibits a higher spatial pattern in the southeast and south, contrasting with lower spatial patterns in the north and west. Low-level soil conservation is predominantly distributed in the northwest, while medium to low-level soil conservation is prevalent in the east of the basin. The trade-off and synergy analysis indicates that between 1995 and 2020, a trade-off relationship existed between carbon storage and habitat quality and water production, whereas synergies were observed between soil conservation and carbon storage, water production and habitat quality, and soil conservation. The correlation between water production and soil conservation emerges as the strongest, whereas the correlation between carbon storage and habitat quality appears to be the weakest. The dynamic spatiotemporal changes, trade-offs, and collaborative relationships of ESs constitute major aspects of ecosystem service research, holding substantial implications for the effective management of the regional ecological environment."
Plant landscape characteristics of mountain traditional villages under cultural ecology: a case study of Pilin village,2025,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f774a5cc7fbec6f6074499d5ac3c2d4c837747f,Ting Yang; Chunlan Du,"With the rapid increase in urbanization, the landscape appearance of traditional village plants under the intensification of human activities is transforming. The lack of knowledge about the characteristics and values of traditional village plant landscapes has led to the “urban parkification” of rural plant landscapes, which makes the style and cultural characteristics of the village gradually fade, there is a need to sort out the characteristics of traditional village plant landscapes to conserve them. From the perspective of cultural ecology, this paper analyzed the characteristics of the plant landscape and its influencing factors in the “production-living-ecological” spaces of traditional mountain villages, selecting Pilin Village in Gaopo Miao Township, Guiyang as a case study. The results showed that Pilin Village has a stepped landscape pattern of “forest-field-village-field-river”, the spatial distribution of the plant landscape was summarized as “natural forest land-surrounding village forest-terraces-garden-farmland”, and the planting structure reflected a different layout in the vertical direction. The plant landscape in the “production-living-ecological” spaces was rich, with obvious differences in the spaces’ characteristics, but they also intersected, showing a “mutual adaptation” relationship with the environment and social humanities. The formation and development of the plant landscape characteristics and style of Pilin Village are the concentrated reflections of multiple factors in the cultural ecosystem, which is a dynamic process of continuous integration and adaptation with the environment from a macroscopic pattern to microscopic construction, reflecting the wisdom of Chinese ethnic minorities’ living environment construction. Based on the analysis of the plant landscape characteristics of Pilin Village and its influencing factors, the need for plant landscape conservation and construction in traditional mountain villages under the background of rural revitalization was determined, and the study provides some reference for contemporary village plant landscape planning, biodiversity conservation, and rural habitat construction."
Launching Nova Geodesia Journal,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f7b5b08b6105f00f0eb0d5caa274fd1810019ef,Paul Sestraș,"Geodesy is the science of measuring and representing the earth, whose beginnings are ancient and are found in antiquity. Like other disciplines, it has known a continuous evolution, along with the evolution of human society and the development of knowledge. More than in other sciences, the evolution of geodesy has been dramatically influenced by advances in science and technology. Thus, at present, modern technology has been reached that allows in-depth studies with the help of state-of-the-art technologies, such as radio telescopes, ground surveys, satellites, etc. In Romania, geodetic education and research have a rich history and tradition, but going through numerous and profound restructuring, intensified in the modern era. These were imposed both by the development of science and technology in the field and by economic and social restructuring at the national level. The turmoil and evolutions from the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century slowly led to the consolidation of the Romanian geodesy and its directions in academic education and research. Ineluctable, things are evolving, and the above issues are being considered by teaching staff and researchers at the universities, research institutes and state and private companies and units with concerns and interests in geodesy. An enthusiastic group of representatives (coming especially from the most recognized universities in Romania, with study programs of land measurements and cadastre) set out to found the new journal Nova Geodesia. After an exhaustive analyzing of the situation of the field in Romania in the current European and international context, they considered that such a journal is timely and necessary in order to support the research in the domain in Romania, but also in the south-eastern part of Europe (facing similar problems) and around the world, truly considering research and creative innovation as the ‘engine of progress’ of humanity. Nova Geodesia has set out to be an open access journal, set up to develop a reliable platform and provide unrestricted access to the scientific literature for the rapid dissemination of recent updates in geodesy and related topics related to cartography, urban administration and the environment, project design and constructions such as dams, bridges, plants, boundary marking, landscape and ecology, environmental management, geography, planetology, hydrography. Through its new approach, the journal adheres to the mission of developing a reliable bridge of communication between people interested in the topics of science and technology mentioned, bringing authentic and unique scientific contributions."
Optimization of Suzhou Garden Infrastructure Layout Based on Federal Learning,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f88df4ba14331d00e63ceef3d82d7629e7b9969,Min Li,"Along with the accelerating urbanization process in China, the problem of urban infrastructure layout has become increasingly prominent. The high density of buildings and the extremely unreasonable distribution of infrastructure make the development face great resistance. This paper reveals the problems in the layout of garden infrastructure by studying and analyzing the theoretical foundations of federal learning and distributed learning and provides an in-depth analysis and elaboration of the problem. The paper uses the shape index and landscape index of green infrastructure (green space, arable land, and water bodies), the average width of roads, road network density, and weighted buildings to conduct a comparative study through the differences in ventilation speed and temperature at different layout garden scales. According to the problems existing in the garden layout in the experimental results, corresponding improvement measures are targeted, and the infrastructure layout of the garden is combined with ecology to make the layout within the garden more suitable."

Embracing challenging complexity: exploring handwashing behavior from a combined socioecological and intersectional perspective in Sierra Leone,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2fa7a23e5b14d694efcd37a207d985376e33406a,H. L. Lanfer; D. Reifegerste,"Handwashing with soap is a cost-effective, efficient health behavior to prevent various diseases. Despite its immense health benefits, the lowest prevalence of handwashing is found in low-income countries. Here, its practice is not only determined by individual behavior, but also heavily shaped by deprivations in the social and structural ecology. Moreover, handwashing barriers are not equally experienced as overlapping social identities (e.g., age and gender) intersect and create inequities between members of different social groups. To embrace the complexities of handwashing beyond individual-level behavior and singular social identities, a combined socioecological and intersectional perspective is employed. This multi-level approach with regards to intersecting privileges and disadvantages serves as a basis to promote this highly important health behavior. This study used a qualitative, theory-based approach and combined data from two samples: experts in health promotion (n = 22) and local citizens stratified by gender and rural/urban location (n = 56). Data was collected in face-to-face interviews in Sierra Leone between November 2018 and January 2019 and analyzed using thematic analysis and typology of the qualitative data. The conceptualization of multi-level determinants of handwashing within a socioecological model showed the high relevance of inhibiting social and structural factors for handwashing practice. By establishing seven distinguishing social identity dimensions, data demonstrates that individuals within the same social setting yet with distinct social identities experience strikingly differing degrees of power and privileges to enact handwashing. While a local leader is influential and may also change structural-level determinants, a young, rural wife experiences multiple social and structural constraints to perform handwashing with soap, even if she has high handwashing intentions. This study provides a holistic analytical framework for the identification of determinants on multiple levels and accumulating intersections of socially produced inequalities for handwashing and is applicable to other health topics. As the exploration of handwashing was approached from a solution-focused instead of a problem-focused perspective, the analysis can guide multi-level intervention approaches (e.g., using low-cost, participatory activities at the community level to make use of the available social capital)."

Such transformations require, on the one hand, large crossborder financial and investment resources and international and local political commitments, and on the other hand, they require great demands from science to develop innovative ecologically adequate tools and methodologies for their implementation, collection of relevant data and mechanisms monitoring to link planetary boundaries with national sustainable development goals, develop innovative solutions, and map out integrated ways to achieve the goals, taking into account trade-offs and synergies between the goals and objectives of ecologically sustainable development.
Global problems of environmental sustainability of the living space on the planet are closely interrelated with corporate activities and investment tools to support ecology and minimize environmental risks, but are often studied and solved separately, which is argued by the authors of the article on the example of China. System integration is critical to understanding socio-economic and environmental interrelationships and creating sustainable solutions.

It concentrates on colonialism’s role in physically, ecologically and culturally re-structuring cities around the world, emphasizing the colonial shaping of urban landscapes –parks and botanical gardens - in Zanzibar and Port of Spain. The chapter shows the divergent, contested and reshaped character of the urban ecologies of these two settings in post-colonial times. British colonialism’s urban parks and gardens in both settings are the focus. Robert Orchard Williams, who served as curator of the botanic gardens of both colonies, serves as a foil for reflecting on the colonial legacy’s different refractions in these two post-colonial settings. The chapter also shows the agency of ordinary people in changing the environmental-spatial structure over time."

Seeking Ecology and Equity Along the Boise Greenbelt,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2fef61b4c1da72bcc6dbf38efb7890a4942454b4,Megan Dixon,"As a pedestrian-friendly green landscape that has become popular in the US and around the world in the past fifty years, the Boise Greenbelt seems to present an ideal example of how to create a waterfront that can promote economic growth along with high recreational use. However, there are two aspects to interrogate as we ponder an effective model for such landscapes going into a future affected by climate change: first, like many such landscapes which focus on an esthetic leisure experience for the user, the Boise Greenbelt does not fully attend to the ecology of the river along which it lies; second, also as a feature of esthetic leisure experience, the Boise Greenbelt falls into a category of “park, café, riverwalk” which potentially reduces equity in use of urban space. Analysis of this landscape and its successes can help to shape a model that will be responsive to future climate conditions and enhance social equity."
Multiple metastable network states in urban traffic,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ffe4b87cbd3667e4b81edf12bef1bffc2875e8c,Guanwen Zeng; Jianxi Gao; L. Shekhtman; Shengmin Guo; Weifeng Lv; Jianjun Wu; Hao Liu; Orr Levy; Daqing Li; Ziyou Gao; H. Stanley; S. Havlin,"Significance Different traffic states experienced by commuters may be due to localized random jams or overall network states, which is decided by system response to perturbations. While for natural systems, the existence of multiple states is common, the evidence for multiple states in transportation has so far been unclear, which hinders our ability to predict and prevent the spread of traffic jams. Based on percolation theory and high-resolution GPS datasets, we find strong evidence for the existence of multiple metastable network states corresponding to distinct system performance regimes. Our results may provide deep insight for a city traffic manager seeking to design early warning signals to prevent the system from shifting to a state of severe congestion. While abrupt regime shifts between different metastable states have occurred in natural systems from many areas including ecology, biology, and climate, evidence for this phenomenon in transportation systems has been rarely observed so far. This limitation might be rooted in the fact that we lack methods to identify and analyze possible multiple states that could emerge at scales of the entire traffic network. Here, using percolation approaches, we observe such a metastable regime in traffic systems. In particular, we find multiple metastable network states, corresponding to varying levels of traffic performance, which recur over different days. Based on high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) datasets of urban traffic in the megacities of Beijing and Shanghai (each with over 50,000 road segments), we find evidence supporting the existence of tipping points separating three regimes: a global functional regime and a metastable hysteresis-like regime, followed by a global collapsed regime. We can determine the intrinsic critical points where the metastable hysteresis-like regime begins and ends and show that these critical points are very similar across different days. Our findings provide a better understanding of traffic resilience patterns and could be useful for designing early warning signals for traffic resilience management and, potentially, other complex systems."
"From Phenology and Habitat Preferences to Climate Change: Importance of Citizen Science in Studying Insect Ecology in the Continental Scale with American Red Flat Bark Beetle, Cucujus clavipes, as a Model Species",2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/300d53339f83e6cdc702d34d4fc1edb02135cf3a,R. Jaskuła; M. Kolanowska; M. Michalski; A. Schwerk,"Simple Summary Studies of widely distributed species often are problematic as such research usually needs to engage a lot of time, a large team of field workers, and big financial support before good quality data will be collected. Citizen scientists allow to study different aspects of species biology and ecology with significantly reduced basic operational costs of such studies. Based on the data deposited in the iNaturalist database, we studied the ecology of the American flat bark beetle in the entire area of its species range. The results clearly show high value of citizen science, particularly in studies focused on habitat preferences and phenology in both recognized subspecies of this taxon. Abstract The American red flat bark beetle, Cucujus clavipes, is a wide distributed saproxylic species divided into two subspecies: ssp. clavipes restricted to eastern regions of North America and ssp. puniceus occurring only in western regions of this continent. Unique morphological features, including body shape and body coloration, make this species easy to recognize even for amateurs. Surprisingly, except some studies focused on physiological adaptations of the species, the ecology of C. clavipes was almost unstudied. Based on over 500 records collected by citizen scientists and deposited in the iNaturalist data base, we studied phenological activity of adult beetles, habitat preferences and impact of future climate change for both subspecies separately. The results clearly show that spp. clavipes and ssp. puniceus can be characterized by differences in phenology and macrohabitat preferences, and their ranges do not overlap at any point. Spp. clavipes is found as more opportunistic taxon occurring in different forests as well as in urban and agricultural areas with tree vegetation always in elevations below 500 m, while elevational distribution of ssp. puniceus covers areas up to 2300 m, and the beetle was observed mainly in forested areas. Moreover, we expect that climate warming will have negative influence on both subspecies with the possible loss of proper niches at level even up to 47–70% of their actual ranges during next few decades. As the species is actually recognized as unthreatened and always co-occurs with many other species, we suggest, because of its expected future habitat loss, to pay more attention to conservationists for possible negative changes in saproxylic insects and/or forest fauna in North America. In addition, as our results clearly show that both subspecies of C. clavipes differ ecologically, which strongly supports earlier significant morphological and physiological differences noted between them, we suggest that their taxonomical status should be verified by molecular data, because very probably they represent separate species."
Microhabitat Structure Affects Ground-Dwelling Beetle Communities More than Temperature along an Urbanization Gradient,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/300d75f9e1e69e35d1af68d500d9530ac8ec82a9,Valentin Cabon; Yann Laurent; Romain Georges; Hervé Quénol; Vincent Dubreuil; B. Bergerot,"Urbanization profoundly alters environmental conditions for organisms, particularly through the urban heat island (UHI) effect, which elevates temperatures in city centers. This study examines the influence of urban environmental variables on rove and ground beetle communities. We sampled 36 grasslands in Rennes (northwestern France), yielding 3317 and 505 staphylinid and carabid adult individuals, respectively, belonging to 121 and 60 species, respectively. Staphylinid and carabid communities are not primarily affected by temperature-related variables. Staphylinids, often overlooked in urban ecology, showed species composition variation to be influenced by habitat and temperature, whereas their functional diversity was positively correlated with herbaceous vegetation height only. In contrast, carabid communities exhibited no significant relationship with the tested environmental variables. This study underscores the taxon-dependent nature of ectotherm’s responses to thermal environments. Although a further investigation into species-specific traits, and particularly dispersal capacities in staphylinids, is needed to advance our understanding of urbanization’s impact, our results indicate that functional diversity in staphylinid assemblages can be favored by locally reducing the mowing frequency or increasing the cutting height within urban green spaces."
"Habitat Patch Metrics for Restoring Species Flow in Urban Context; Special Reference to Fragmentation of Colombo Wetlands, Sri Lanka.",2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30112ecead5ed2be4f3205f07827909e04d24ee6,M. Ekanayake,"
 BackgroundColombo wetlands (CW) are the last ecological frontier of the Sri Lankan National capital. CW network has Classified as the most vulnerable ecosystem under the Ramsar convention which suffered from severe fragmentation due to human encroachments and urban densifications. Over the past few decades, 31% of habitat loss resulted in the dislocation and extinction of many species in the wetland forest. Currently, restoration efforts are taking place to rehabilitate the ecology through wetland parks and ecological patches. However, promotion of the species movement is not evident through the development of isolated patches due to fewer considerations of the connectivity in the Urban matrix. Therefore, management of ecological network connectivity is a predominant measure to rehabilitate the CW habitats. Even though the literature suggests that patch metrics are a vital threshold to predict the species flow rates, lack of scientific research involved in such phenomenon in Sri Lanka. Thus, this study experimentally investigates the role of ecological patch metrics towards connectivity index in Colombo urban wetlands. The study equips remote sensing data 2018 to calculate the wetland patch metrics (Configuration) of Total area (TA), Total edge (TE), Shape Index (SI), Core area index (CAI), and Inter-patch distances (IPD) for 3 sample locations. GIS modeled Least cost paths within CW boundaries are acquired to calculate the Species flow Index (SFI) per patch for common species. ResultsThe Pearson correlation test explicitly proves that (P< 0.05) the SFI co-related with TA, TE, CAI, and IPD. A strong positive correlation was observed in patch metrics of TA, TE, and CAI and a strong negative in IPD against SFI. Furthermore, based on connectivity contributions, the study proposed three wetland patch classifications as open patches, closed patches, and active patches the which are rated upon the species flow. ConclusionIn city-level implications, improvement of total area, perimeter, and reduction of interpatch distance for “active wetland patch” will result in re-gaining the species flow for Colombo wetlands. The overall study is an applied model for restoring urban ecological networks to gain maximize connectivity index to preserve species richness in urban ecological networks."

Here, we examined priority AMR phenotypes and genotypes of Escherichia coli isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) found on concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). European starlings may be present in high numbers on CAFOs (>100,000 birds), interact with urban environments, and can migrate distances exceeding 1,500 km in North America. In this study, 1,477 European starlings from 31 feedlots in five U.S. states were sampled for E. coli resistant to third generation cephalosporins (3G-C) and fluoroquinolones. The prevalence of 3G-C and fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli was 4% and 10%, respectively. Multidrug resistance in the E. coli isolates collected (n = 236) was common, with the majority of isolates displaying resistance to six or more classes of antibiotics. Genetic analyses of a subset of these isolates identified 94 genes putatively contributing to AMR, including seven class A and C β-lactamases as well as mutations in gyrA and parC recognized to confer resistance to quinolones. Phylogenetic and subtyping assessments showed that highly similar isolates (≥99.4% shared core genome, ≥99.6% shared coding sequence) with priority AMR were found in birds on feedlots separated by distances exceeding 150 km, suggesting that European starlings could be involved in the interstate dissemination of priority AMR bacteria."
Extra‐pair paternity enhances the reproductive fitness of urban Chinese blackbird,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/302243c45baa6fb720e763eb66180aa43b20d77c,Xueli Zhang; Zhen Zhang; Wenjing Lu; Yao Sheng; Fang Ming; Longjian Ma; Chaoying Zhu; Mingwang Chen; Xinqi Lu; Yuancheng Liu; Guanglong Sun; Luzhang Ruan,"Urbanization is a human‐induced process of rapid habitat change that can affect the reproductive success of animals. The occurrence of extra‐pair paternity (EPP) may be sensitive to changes in urban ecological conditions. In this study, the Chinese blackbird Turdus mandarinus, a common breeding bird in southern Chinese cities, was selected as the focus species to explore the EPP patterns of monogamous birds in developing cities and the relationship between pairs. Over four breeding seasons, 316 Chinese blackbird nestlings and 20 adults in both urban and rural areas were monitored and genotyped for 11 microsatellite loci to determine progeny affinity. We confirmed that both the brood size and hatching rate of EPP nests were significantly larger than those of within‐pair paternity (WPP) nests. The body mass, beak length, head length, and body length of 12‐day age extra‐pair offspring (EPO) were significantly greater than those of within‐pair offspring (WPO), suggesting important benefits of EPP. However, in accordance with the analyses of nest ecological variables, we concluded that EPP occurs most often in areas with low urbanization levels, indicating some constraints for this reproductive strategy in cities. Our findings provide new insights about how this growing human‐induced landscape change affects mating behaviour in birds, an important aspect in avian ecology and evolution."
The politics of greening unceded lands in the settler city,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/303161a8c368ddb86ec188b4e291b9eab749f24a,Libby Porter; J. Hurst; Tina Grandinetti,"ABSTRACT Urban greening is a buzz term in urban policy and research settings in Australia and elsewhere. In a context of settler colonial urbanism, like Australia, a first fact becomes clear: urban greening is always being practiced on unceded Indigenous lands. Recognising this requires some honest reckoning with how this latest urban policy response perpetuates dispossessory settler-colonial structures. In this paper, we listen to the place-based ontologies of the peoples and lands from where we write to inform understanding the city as an always already Indigenous place – a sovereign Aboriginal City. In so doing, the paper tries to practice a way of creating more truthful and response-able urban knowledge practices. We analyse three distinct areas of scholarly research that are present in the contemporary literature: urban greening and green infrastructure; urban political ecology; and more-than-human cities. When placed in relationship of learning with the sovereign Aboriginal City, our analysis finds that these scholarly domains of urban greening work to re-organise colonial power relations. The paper considers what work the practice and scholarship of ‘urban greening’ might need to do in order to become response-able and learn to learn with Indigenous sovereignties and ontologies."

"First Population Study on Winter Breeding Monarch Butterflies, Danaus plexippus (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) in the Urban South Bay of San Francisco, California",2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3039e960322e0d46237bb6b7d68e572328bb0727,D. James; M. Schaefer; Karen Krimmer Easton; Annie Carl,"Simple Summary Populations of western monarch butterflies, which formerly populated coastal overwintering sites in California in numbers exceeding one million, dwindled to less than 2000 in 2020/21. In the same winter, breeding populations of monarchs occurred commonly in the San Francisco Bay urban area for the first time. The urgent conservation need to understand this possible shift in overwintering strategy prompted this first study of the viability and ecology of monarch breeding populations in the South Bay urban area of San Francisco during January–June 2021. Adult monarchs along with eggs and larvae were common during winter and most of spring, utilizing non-native ornamental milkweed and multiple nectar sources from native and ornamental plants. Evidence from weekly counts and tagged butterflies indicated increased dispersal to the north and east during late April-mid-May, possibly representing spring migration to the Pacific Northwest and eastern California. Infection of reared adult monarchs with a protozoan parasite was high. Winter breeding of monarchs in the San Francisco urban area as an alternative and sustainable overwintering strategy for the western US population will likely depend on the continued presence of ornamental milkweeds, sustainable co-existence of monarchs and protozoan parasites, and successful migration to the greater western US during spring. Abstract The western North American monarch butterfly population assessed by counts of non-reproductive overwintering butterflies at coastal sites in California declined to less than 2000 in 2020/21. Simultaneously, reports of reproductive monarchs increased in San Francisco urban areas, perhaps representing a shift in overwintering strategy. To better understand monarch winter breeding in the Bay area, we studied adult and immature populations in Santa Clara County during January–June 2021. Adult monarchs were common with numbers ranging from 0.23–1.54/min during ~30 min weekly surveys at one site, with lowest numbers late April to mid-May. Eggs and larvae, primarily on ornamental milkweeds, were found on nearly all survey dates with lowest numbers mid-late April to mid-May. Levels of infection of adults by the parasite Ophryocystis elektroscirrha were consistently high during the study (69.3–77.5%). From 499 monarchs tagged post-eclosion, recovery rates of 19.2–23.6% occurred from releases in January-February and May-June but only 11.9–13.0% from March-April releases. Although distances were small, butterflies tagged in April were recovered from greater distances than other months. Tagged monarchs flew primarily north or east. There were reduced numbers of adult monarchs during late April-mid-May with some evidence of northerly and easterly emigration at the same time from tagged butterflies, suggesting some movement out of the South Bay area, perhaps representing spring migration. We conclude that monarchs can successfully breed and maintain populations on ornamental milkweeds during winter at urban sites in the South Bay of San Francisco and may still migrate during spring to remain part of the wider western population."

Bermúdez; M. Ortega‐Sánchez,"Abstract. Estuarine dynamics are highly complex as a result of the temperature and salinity gradients, as well as the multiple interactions between atmospheric, maritime, and hydrological forcing agents. Given the environmental and socioeconomic importance of estuaries and their current and future threats due to human interventions and climate change, it is of vital importance to characterize these dynamics, monitor their evolution, and quantify the expected impacts derived from climate change. This paper presents a hybrid database combining data obtained in six field surveys (in 2012, 2013, and 2015) and results from a physically based 3D numerical model for the Bay of Cádiz (southern Spain), a highly anthropized mesotidal estuary. The 3D dataset includes water levels, currents, density, and wave climate, allowing for an analysis of bay dynamics at different timescales ranging from intratidal processes to seasonal variabilities. The results offer an example of the potential uses of the dataset and include (1) an assessment of the spatial and seasonal variability of the estuarine dynamics and (2) an analysis of the effects of severe weather events. These examples provide convincing evidence regarding how the dataset can be employed in multiple research fields and applications, including ocean–bay interactions, water exchange between basins, longwave and shortwave propagation along creek systems, and energy extraction of tidal waves. Therefore, this hybrid dataset may be of significant interest for stakeholders and scientists from different sectors (water engineering, ecology, urban development, energy, etc.) working on the environmental management of the Gulf of Cádiz and other tidally dominated shallow bays. It can also serve as a benchmark test for numerical hydrodynamic models, infrastructure intervention assessments (e.g., dikes or breakwaters), or renewable energy conversion system models.

Dispersal ability predicts spatial genetic structure in native mammals persisting across an urbanization gradient,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30603d56a39d342a975996603462fdbc7fc8db8e,J.

McGreevy,"As the rate of urbanization continues to increase globally, a growing body of research is emerging that investigates how urbanization shapes the movement—and consequent gene flow—of species in cities. Of particular interest are native species that persist in cities, either as small relict populations or as larger populations of synanthropic species that thrive alongside humans in new urban environments. In this study, we used genomic sequence data (SNPs) and spatially explicit individual‐based analyses to directly compare the genetic structure and patterns of gene flow in two small mammals with different dispersal abilities that occupy the same urbanized landscape to evaluate how mobility impacts genetic connectivity. We collected 215 white‐footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and 380 big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) across an urban‐to‐rural gradient within the Providence, Rhode Island (U.S.A.) metropolitan area (population =1,600,000 people). We found that mice and bats exhibit clear differences in their spatial genetic structure that are consistent with their dispersal abilities, with urbanization having a stronger effect on Peromyscus mice. There were sharp breaks in the genetic structure of mice within the Providence urban core, as well as reduced rates of migration and an increase in inbreeding with more urbanization. In contrast, bats showed very weak genetic structuring across the entire study area, suggesting a near‐panmictic gene pool likely due to the ability to disperse by flight. Genetic diversity remained stable for both species across the study region. Mice also exhibited a stronger reduction in gene flow between island and mainland populations than bats. This study represents one of the first to directly compare multiple species within the same urban‐to‐rural landscape gradient, an important gap to fill for urban ecology and evolution. Moreover, here we document the impacts of dispersal capacity on connectivity for native species that have persisted as the urban landscape matrix expands."

Pangestu,"Plants are living things, plants can affect the lives of other living things, so it can be said that plants can affect an ecosystem. Horticulture is one of the most diverse types of plants in Indonesia, and can be grown in urban areas such as Jakarta. The ecology of horticultural plants must be studied to complement the urban landscape design of urban green open spaces and can also be consumed by the community. However, people's knowledge about horticultural plants that can be consumed is very lacking, especially the habits of urban people who tend to consume fast food, where this habit is actually not good for the body and the ecosystem. Therefore, we need a container that is able to revive and be able to develop horticultural plants that blend with the existing site conditions. Thus, the presence of an architectural container for growing horticultural crops does not damage the existing ecosystem conditions. The combination of ecological science, architectural technology, architectural methods, and technology for growing horticultural plants is expected to create an architectural container for horticultural plants to develop well and can attract people's interest to know several types of horticultural plants. Because knowledge and human health greatly affect the quality of an ecosystem. The horticulture that is planted is also a plant that can grow in the tropics, especially the selected site area, namely in North Jakarta. Thus, horticulture not only provides education to the public, but can grow, and fill urban public spaces, such as parks. Thus, a new ecosystem is created that is beneficial to fellow living things. Keywords: Ecology; Horticulture; Urbanism LandscapeAbstrakTumbuhan adalah makhluk hidup, tumbuhan dapat mempengaruhi kehidupan makhluk hidup lainnya, sehingga dapat dikatakan tumbuhan dapat mempengaruhi suatu ekosistem. Hortikultura merupakan salah satu jenis tanaman yang sangat beragam di Indonesia, dan dapat tumbuh di daerah perkotaan seperti Jakarta. Ekologi tanaman hortikultura harus dipelajari untuk melengkapi design landskap urbanisme ruang terbuka hijau kota dan juga dapat dikonsumsi oleh masyarakat. Namun, pengetahuan masyarakat tentang tanaman hortikultura yang bisa dikonsumsi sangat kurang, terutama kebiasaan masyarakat kota yang lebih cenderung mengkonsumsi makanan cepat saji, dimana kebiasaan ini sebenarnya tidak baik untuk tubuh dan ekosistem. Oleh karena itu, diperlukan suatu wadah yang mampu menghidupkan dan mampu mengembangkan tanaman hortikultura yang menyatu dengan kondisi tapak eksisting. Sehingga, kehadiran wadah arsitektur untuk menanam tanaman hortikultura tidak merusak kondisi ekosistem yang sudah ada. Perpaduan antara ilmu ekologi,  teknologi arsitektur, metode arsitektur, dan teknologi menanam tanaman hortikultura diharapkan dapat menciptakan wadah arsitektur untuk tanaman hortikultura berkembang baik dan dapat menarik minat masyarakat untuk mengenal beberapa jenis tanaman hortikultura. Sebab, pengetahuan dan kesehatan manusia pun sangat mempengaruhi kualitas suatu ekosistem. Hortikultura yang ditanam juga merupakan tanaman yang dapat tumbuh didaerah tropis, terutama daerah tapak terpilih, yaitu di Jakarta Utara. Dengan demikian, hortikultura tidak hanya memberikan edukasi kepada masyarakat, tetapi dapat tumbuh, dan mengisi ruang publik perkotaan, seperti taman. Sehingga, tercipta ekosistem baru yang bermanfaat bagi sesama makhluk hidup. "

Yoon; Gunwoo Kim,"The purpose of this study is to classify types of urban flower landscape. As a result of the study, first, through literature and case review, it was found that the four elements of place element, form element, natural element, artificial element, should be included in the sentence and key expression for defining the concept of flower landscape. In contemplating these four elements, a newly reconstructed concept of flower landscape was presented. This is expected to be the basis for the flower landscape integration theory. Second, flower landscape was defined as a genre and a unit of urban landscape. In addition, in order to build a system of flower landscape as a specialized area, after considering the concept, characteristics, and functions of a large category of urban landscape, its hierarchical categories with flower landscape were newly arranged. Thus, the flower landscape as an urban landscape was suggested. Third, in order to provide rational selection materials to consumers through type classification, related theories were investigated by expanding not only to the flower field, but also to the urban planning and urban ecology fields. 41 elements for the type classification were extracted, and 4 core elements were derived through the clustering process. Based on the 4 elements as the classification criteria, through the opinion verification from the FGI with experts, 9 types of middle-classification and 30 types of small-classification were derived. As a follow-up research suggestion, if a valid type is additionally established through a monitoring in the type application process, and more specified application types are developed and organized by expanding second-level classification hierarchy to the third-level hierarchy, this will lead to great studies improving the system of the types."

Rivers also provide habitat and balance the ecosystem for the environment. Currently, the community is neglecting many rivers in that their water becomes polluted and unusable. This is the reason behind the existence of riverbank development, including in Cisadane Riverside located in Tangerang, Indonesia. This study was carried out in Cisadane Riverside to observe and analyse the elements that constructed the riverbank as public facilities toward sustainable pillars: environment, social and economy for urban sustainability. Observation and interview were conducted in six zones along the Cisadane Riverside. Regarding the riverbank development, it is important to pay attention to the environmental aspect to maintain the urban ecology while achieving the social and economic aspects. In conclusion, the riverbank development that considered the integrated environment, social and economic aspects would create the activity and interaction space for supporting both the urban sustainability particularly for the riverbank itself. The result of this study would be used as the reference for riverfront development towards urban sustainability in Indonesia."
Potential of Public and Professional Communications in Implementation of Urban Environmental Programs,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30bfc3716b58e65aa7eadafa2424d5e12fe7bbf7,Irina V. Topchiy; A. Fatkullina,"this article is an independent study of moscow residents’ extent of awareness of the urban environmental programs. the aim of the study is to develop measures to support the urban ecology by schools of architecture. in 2019, the authors carried out a sociological survey with participation of several socially active groups: students of moscow schools of architecture, participants of the moscow longevity Project and schoolchildren. the survey results showed that respondents are nearly unaware of the environmental doctrine of the russian federation, the un sustainable development goals and urban development programs. and, this is an impediment to implementation of environmental projects. since the success and speed of implementation of environmental projects today to a greater extent depends on the combined actions of professionals: engineers, architects, economists, transport specialists, administrative workers and other persons who are ‘line of duty’ responsible for the quality of the urban life. and, support of residents who live, work and rest in the city space. the influence of residents on the final decision is really great, and they can be called ‘non-professional players’ of architectural and urban planning activities. due to mismatching local and global interests, the desire to preserve the prevailing everyday habits and poor understanding of the long-term benefits from implementation of large-scale projects, residents’ opinion concerning the prospects for urban development may not coincide with the opinion of professionals. and then conflicts arise. environmental upbringing and education, covering all social groups of the urban population and including various types of activities, are today recognized as the most effective way to promote environmental projects. the survey proves that the respondents are well informed about the environmental problems of the city and unanimously believe that the responsibility for the implementation of the Projects lies with the city administration. they are ready to embrace an ‘ecological lifestyle’ if it brings economic benefits and does not disturb the customary lifestyle. it is concluded that in order to attract moscow residents to implementation of environmental programs, it is necessary to be increasingly cognizant of the differences in the interests of social groups, replace economic pressure with economic benefits, and upscale an ecological lifestyle via media and public additional education."
Using Geological and Topographic Maps in Site Selection of Solid Waste Disposal,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30ca329489a4683aa28be5d88fea4125e956169e,Ali i. Eliawa,"Currently, land shortage for solid waste in most urban areas is a significant and growing potential problem. Although some efforts are made to decrease and recover the waste, landfill is still the most common process for waste disposal. Site selection of solid waste dumping in urban areas is a serious subject because of its huge effect on the economy, ecology, and environmental health. Consequently, several criteria must be created because of the difficulty of the parameters to select the process for combination in social, environmental and technical parameters. In this research, the most appropriate sites for locating dumping garbage are determined using the Geographical Information System (GIS) by implementing both methods Boolean logic model and Index overlay model.  Based on several objectives, a provided spatial data set consisting of several maps in the form of layers, such as land use, geological distribution, landslides, etc., were used in the modeling process to choose the best site to dump the garbage of Chinchina city that used as a case in this application. The findings show that the Boolean logic model identified only two areas that met the criteria, whereas the Index overlay model identified three important classes through weight; unsuitable, moderate and suitable regions for construction waste disposal. "

Materials and Methods: Overall, 130 free-roaming cats were captured, of which 52 were Tom (male), 69 were Queen (female), and 9 were kittens. Regarding their ages, the cats were divided into three groups: <1 year as kittens, 1 to 2 years as young, and adults over two years. Thirty blood samples were drawn from the cephalic or saphenous veins of the hind leg for hematological and serum biochemical analysis. 
Results: The findings revealed that the average hemoglobin concentration was significantly higher in kittens than in young and adult cats (p < 0.05). In comparison to young and adult cats, kit¬tens had considerably greater red blood cell, packed cell volume, mean corpuscular volume, and platelet counts, whereas mature cats had much higher white blood cell counts. The number of lymphocytes and monocytes was shown to be non-significant, while other components, such as neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, varied considerably by age group. Rural cats showed sig¬nificantly (p < 0.05) higher alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase, whereas urban cats showed higher serum glucose (p < 0.001). The duration of the cat’s estrous cycle was (5.63 ± 1.75) days, as were the inter-estrous phase’s length (7 days), gestation time (66.6 days), and queening rate (65.2). There were 3.92 ± 0.55 kittens per litter. Males reached puberty at a young age of 9.3 months, while females did so at 8.3 months. 
Conclusion: These findings may contribute to the growing body of research on free-roaming cat populations, which is important for understanding the ecology and behavior of these cats and constructing strategies for their conservation and welfare."

Hou; Changyue Wu; Jing Yang; Wei He; L. Xiang,"Ningxia Province is rich in energy but fragile in ecology. How to coordinate sustainable utilization of natural capital and the fragile ecological environment is a significant guarantee for social-economic development. This study uses the improved three-dimensional ecological footprint to characterize the utilization status of natural capital flows and stocks in Ningxia Province from 2004 to 2017. Additionally, the driving factors behind changes in the natural capital stock are revealed by the partial least squares method (PLS). The results are as follows: (1) From 2004 to 2017, ecological footprint increased rapidly in Ningxia Province at an annual rate of 4.52%, resulting in a increase of the ecological deficit from 1.64 to 3.85 gha/cap at an annual rate of 6.8%, among which, Yinchuan city and Shizuishan city had the largest ecological deficit, while Guyuan city basically maintained ecological surplus. The fossil energy land and cropland were the main components of ecological footprint. (2) The consumption of capital stock in Ningxia Province continued to grow at an annual rate of 3.12%, from a value of 2.28 times overusing the existing area in 2004, increasing to 3.41 times in 2017. While the EF size increased slightly with an annual rate of 1.95%. The capital stock consumption was concentrated in Yinchuan and Shizuishan, and the capital flow consumption was concentrated in Wuzhong, Guyuan, and Zhongwei. (3) The capital flows of forest land and built-up land basically meet consumption demand, while the capital stock occupation of grassland, water and fossil energy land was serious. By 2017, the capital flow of cropland could basically satisfy people’s consumption demand. (4) The urbanization rate, GDP, the secondary industry output value and per capita consumption expenditure of urban residents were the main influence factors on the natural capital stock consumption. These findings not only are of real significance in promoting the coordinated development between economy and natural capital utilization in Ningxia Province but also have policy implications in improving the utilization efficiency of natural capital in energy-rich ecologically fragile regions."
Urban socioeconomic variation influences the ecology and evolution of trophic interactions.,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/310b90415100f0aa7b61b4f8bb403f217aa0ec40,Ella Martin; Samer El-Galmady; Marc T J Johnson,"As urbanization expands, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how anthropogenic activity is affecting ecological and evolutionary processes. Few studies have examined how human social patterns within cities can modify eco-evolutionary dynamics. We tested how socioeconomic variation corresponds with changes in trophic interactions and natural selection on prey phenotypes using the classic interaction between goldenrod gall flies (Eurosta solidaginis) and their natural enemies: birds, beetles, and parasitoid wasps. We sampled galls from 84 sites across neighbourhoods with varying socioeconomic levels, and quantified the frequency of predation/parasitism on flies and natural selection by each enemy. We found that bird predation was higher in the highest income neighbourhoods, increasing the strength of selection for smaller galls. Wasp and beetle attack, but not their strength of selection, increased in lower income neighbourhoods. We show that socioeconomic variation in cities can have strong unintended consequences for the ecology and evolution of trophic interactions."

Scarborough; C. Isendahl,"Identifying and employing the concept of sustainability in the social sciences remain a challenge. One approach presented here emphasizes its utility in examining past urban adaptations primarily from the archaeological record that demonstrate the role of low-density urbanism. Drawing upon early semitropical cities and their dispersed land-use and settlement patterns, both longevity and interconnectivity are shown to have developed in the context of environmental and societal diversity. The impact of climate change to our near-term futures can result in adaptations that accommodate positive societal transformations if all relevant disciplines are included in the dialogue. Past sustainable practices when melded with thoughtfully deployed technologies of today and tomorrow will assist with this new ecology. We argue that generating knowledge about tropical urban systems in the ancient past adds to a more diversified pool of urban models from which to draw for future urban planning. We specifically suggest that networked urban systems of distributed, low-density settlement repeatedly occurring throughout the tropical archaeological records have several social–environmental benefits toward a sustainability transition of cities in the era of climate change."

Justification of the key factors that have an impact on the introduction of promising ecological transport in the system of urban passenger transport in order to improve the quality of transport services for passengers and improve ecology in densely populated cities. Materials and methods. To achieve the goal, the fuzzy Dematel method is used, which is based on graph theory and allows to classify all available factors that influence decision-making based on cause-and-effect relationships. Results. The eight key factors that form the transport project and the factors that have a significant impact on them are substantiated for the implementation of the transport project of the implementation of promising ecological passenger transport on urban routes into the transport system of urban passenger transportation. These include the level of development of modern transport technologies when transporting passengers on city routes and the availability of their support centers; the availability of financial programs for updating/restructuring the rolling stock fleet of the motor vehicle enterprise and the availability of the appropriate legal framework for preferential operation of electric passenger transport; rapid adaptation of the transport infrastructure of a modern city for the operation of ecological transport; compliance of ecological transport with the transport characteristics of the passenger transportation route; operational properties of a modern electric bus; the effect of relevant legislative initiatives regarding benefits for the purchase and costs of operating electric vehicles. Scientific novelty consists in identifying the interrelationships between the factors that form the transport project and the factors that have a significant influence on them, on the implementation of the transport project of the implementation of promising ecological passenger transport on urban routes into the transport system of urban passenger transport, which allows to estimate the possible economic costs of road transport enterprises carrying out passenger transportation. Practical significance lies in the determination of key factors that can be used for the implementation of a transport project for the use of promising ecological passenger transport in the system of urban passenger road transport"
Detecting Wildfires Using Satellite Imagery,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31471cbb82edbbee9b877245ffe48257a50c753e,Animesh Singh; Parul Madan; Pradeep Kumar Arya; Vasim Sheikh; Mukul Gupta; Rupansh Kumar,"The research “Wildfire Detection from Satellite Images” addresses the formidable challenge of automating the classification of diverse visible range satellite images through an innovative integration of machine learning and computer vision using custom dataset. In contrast to conventional methods relying on manual observations, this pioneering venture leverages a meticulously curated dataset representing a broad spectrum of satellite images in various environmental contexts. The binary classification model, at the research's core, combines the strengths of diverse machine learning algorithms, employing ensemble learning techniques to enhance accuracy and versatility across different ecological conditions. Climate action is a key Sustainable Development Goal (SDG-13) of the United Nations (UN), and wildfires are one of the calamitous events that is both caused by and contribute to climate change. Large scale wildfires have increased significantly in frequency in Australia and other wildfire prone nations in recent years. These fires pose a threat to urban and global forests, inflict a significant amount of harm to property and the environment, and frequently result in fatalities. There is a continuous discussion about how to manage wildfires and lessen their social, economic, and environmental effects. With different rising monitoring systems and various applications of those system emerge to observe the ecology and environment of the globe. This research showcases the intricate relation of technology with nature. By deploying machine learning/ deep learning model to observe different events of the globe, we can easily develop system to detect any drastic climate event such as Wildfires and take preventive measures at early stages reducing causality and losses."

First, vegetation regulates the flow of numerous biogeochemical cycles, most critically those of water, carbon, and nitrogen; it is also of great importance in local and global energy balances. Such cycles are important not only for global patterns of vegetation but also for those of climate. The results of the vegetation study can be accompanied by other ecological parameters to assess the changes occurring in the local ecology The results may further be utilized to study the capability of the vegetation cover to mitigate the harmful effects of pollutionØ the results of the study may further be utilized to create a framework for planning and developing urban areas having higher carbon mitigating capabilities.Trees absorb Carbon dioxide from atmosphere and stored by photosynthesis, balancing the atmospheric Carbon dioxide in form of Carbon as Biomass.

An organizational ecology approach to new food marts in New York City neighbourhoods,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/316f0e0de0447edce123f9036f8e2d2047d46099,J. Olvera; Stacey Sutton,"ABSTRACT Global forces have disrupted local businesses across cities, but neighbourhood convenience stores and small grocery stores have proven to be resilient in the face of economic and institutional pressures. In this paper, we integrate urban retail and organizational ecology perspectives and examine small independently-owned convenience and grocery stores, colloquially referred to as food marts, as organizational populations that develop and persist in neighbourhoods across multiple decades. Drawing on data from the National Establishment Time Series database and the Decennial Census, we argue that a nonlinear relationship exists between the number of existing food marts and the emergence of new food marts. Furthermore, we examine how conditions such as the presence of chain stores, neighbourhood socio-economic conditions and ethno-racial composition affect the likelihood that new food marts will emerge in neighbourhoods. Our results show that the emergence of new food marts in neighbourhoods is strongly influenced by the existing number of similar firm types. In other words, we find that competition among new food marts strongly predicts the extent to which small food marts remain in neighbourhoods. The value our study is that we look beyond the individual firm and ask whether the entire population is at risk, for example when chain stores are present."

Lumbierres; Roberto Meseguer; Alexandre Levi‐Mourao; Xavier Pons,"Green spaces in urban areas, such as parks and gardens, provide recreational, social, and health benefits for more than half of the world’s inhabitants. Arthropods in urban vegetation may cause some disruption to humans but also provide vital ecological services such as biological control and pollination. However, little is known about the ecology of urban pests, their natural enemies, and how to manage them in an ecofriendly manner, especially in Southern Europe. In this review article, we consider the information available concerning the biological control of aphids in the urban green areas of Spain, mainly focusing on the different aphid species, their natural enemies (and how to enhance them), and the sampling methods used to study them. A wide range of aphid species is found in Spain, but only a few are responsible for the majority of damage (so-called k-aphids, most of which are holocyclic species), and these show two distinct injury profiles (short and long) that determine monitoring and control strategies. Urban aphids have numerous natural enemies, including more than 20 species of ladybeetles, as well as predatory hoverflies, midges, lacewings, bugs, and other groups. More than 40 species of aphid parasitoids and their tritrophic aphid plant associations have been reported. The availability and usefulness of commercially reared aphid natural enemies is discussed, and two methods to enhance natural enemies are described. We also review aphid sampling methods developed for urban green spaces. The studies provide basic information on the ecology of aphids to support conservation biological control as a reliable strategy in the urban green areas of Spain."

However, the campus landscape has not been explored to promote sustainability. To address this gap, this paper provides a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature on the sustainable campus landscape. The various aspects outlined in this research can be used as a reference for building a sustainable campus landscape for higher education institutions in Vietnam. The results of the study indicate that a sustainable campus landscape must be expressed through five aspects including (1) Enhancing ecological functions in urban areas, (2) Promoting sustainability of landscape and habitats, (3) Supporting the educational and experiential activities, (4) Enhancing physical and mental health for people, (5) Preserving and promoting historical cultural values. As a case study, Vietnam needs a change in cognition to foster innovation toward building a more sustainable campus landscape in higher education institutions in the future. Approaches are suitable for Vietnam include (1) Taking educational goals as a premise, (2) Taking people as the center, (3) Taking sustainable ecology as the foundation, (4) Taking science and technology as the mainstay, (5) Taking culture, history, and aesthetics as the identity."

Meng; Shan-shan. Man; Yidan Wang,"Currently, urbanization driven by global capital flows entails a main trend in many large cites in China, while global capital investment in small inland cities especially in western China is extremely scarce, where their globalization characters the powerful nationalization power and market activation. Dunhuang, a small inland city in western China, has transformed successfully from an agricultural county to an international tourist city, a platform for worldwide cultural communication, and a node city in the Belt and Road region because of its unique and brilliant resources: Mogao Grottoes and Dunhuangology. Therefore, this paper develops a conceptual framework of the multiple cooperative mechanisms and globalization path (MCMGP) of Dunhuang, elaborating the process of industrial transformation, urban globalization, and multiple cooperative mechanisms between government and market actors based on interviewing records and statistics. Findings show that the MCMGP features government-led intervention, resource orientation, and centralization that embodies the driver of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Also, the MCM in Dunhuang’s globalization contains the mechanism of enrolment, mobilization and action, governance and global marketing, distributed in the two phases. Equally important, in response to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Silk Road (Dunhuang) International Cultural Expo (SRDICE) from the state, the city government has significantly reinvested and refined cultural tourism via governance mechanisms, carving out a key node city in the Silk Road and elevating an international tourist city. Environmentally, Dunhuang’s tourism internationalization enhances the process of the development of a sustainable shared mobility industry. Furthermore, its tourism development and social–ecology system maintain the synergistic relationships which international tourism promotes such as urban ecosystem and public welfare and in turn, social–ecological enhancement serve Dunhuang’s international tourism well. Practical implications of how Dunhuang’s experience may have lessons for others are discussed in China’s peculiar socialist market economy discourse."

In the evaluation meeting consisted of three main sessions under the titles of “Analysis of Past Earthquakes in Turkey and Due Diligence of Current Earthquakes”, “Problems Caused by the 2023 East Anatolian Fault Line Earthquakes and their Interaction” and “Possible Earthquakes Awaiting Turkey and Suggestions from Different Scientific Disciplines”, nearly 50 scientists from 23 universities and over 20 different scientific disciplines came together and shared their views. In this meeting, earth sciences and technical analyzes for the earthquakes were discussed as well as the fact that multidimensional presentations were delivered on disaster management, education, ecology and environment, agriculture and livestock, crisis management and communication, urban planning, psychology, law, and public health taking into account the situations before and after the earthquakes. This report in your hand has been prepared through a compilation of research, examination, observation, opinions and suggestions of the participants of the meeting within the scope of the presentations made at the meeting. The earthquake disaster has shown us once again that the response to disasters starts with risk reduction studies and making the necessary preparations before the disaster happens, not after it happens. For this reason, it has become quite essential to prepare a national disaster response plan that is comprehensive and in line with the requirements of the age, as well as providing a good zoning planning and correct construction conditions, and especially to make the training and practice stages work. We can reduce losses and damage and build resilience against earthquakes with a sustainable disaster management system where the post-earthquake is planned in advance, individuals receive the necessary training, and social preparedness, sensitivity and awareness are at the highest level."

Frolova; Antoniy Elias Sverdrup; H. Sverdrup,"The Kaban Lakes Integrated Assessment Model (KLIAM) was developed for the lake hydrology, chemistry, and plankton dynamics of the Nizhniy Kaban and Sredniy Kaban lakes, Kazan, Russia. KLIAM is able to describe the variations seen in the Kaban lakes chemical and biological states as far seen through measurements available at the moment. KLIAM is able to reconstruct the lake history as it is approximately known from the data and written narratives. KLIAM was used to assess the measures to return the lakes to their original pre-urban status as alkaline and semi-oligotrophic lakes. The Kaban Lakes periodically goes through plankton blooms, as seen in the lake in the last decades since before World War II, which are caused by plankton growth promoted by phosphorus and nitrogen coming to the lakes as pollution from the human environment. In the new plans for development of the area surrounding the Nizhniy Kaban and Sredniy Kaban lakes, we suggest that attention is paid to reducing phosphorus and nitrogen flows to the lakes, as the best way to improve their ecological status. This is based on simulations with KLIAM. We recommend that the monitoring of lake chemistry and lake ecology is improved with reoccurring analysis of samples from the Kaban Lakes."
Development of Urban Waste Recycling Industry from the Perspective of Ecology,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31df23e13203776135a6ae8a2b6afe4dd08ce2fc,Qian Luo,"Urban garbage has become an important field affecting the healthy development of urban ecology, and urban ecological environment protection has naturally become a crucial part in the process of modern urban development. Deepening the relevant concepts of ecological and environmental protection also makes modern cities pay attention to the recycling and utilization of waste resources. This work is combined with the development status of urban waste recycling industry. Taking urban construction waste and domestic waste as examples, this paper focuses on the operation model and development path of urban waste recycling industry. For example, in the aspect of domestic waste treatment, the resource industrialization path of incineration fly ash is proposed, focusing on the water washing and dechlorination of incineration fly ash, the production of unburned ceramsite from water washed fly ash, and the separation and recovery of inorganic salts in fly ash water washing solution. The results show that the recoveries of NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2 are 96.21%, 95.85%, and 94.72%. Through the analysis of social, environmental, and economic benefits, the government, scientific research institutions, and enterprises are encouraged to make joint efforts to develop the construction waste recycling industry, so as to fundamentally solve the current situation of “mountains of garbage and cities surrounded by garbage” in China."

Coates; Anja Nygren,"In this article, we examine the coproduction of hazardous urban space and new formations of clientelist state governance. Work on hazards and vulnerability frequently demonstrates how hazardous urban spaces are produced, but a critical understanding of state power is often left untouched. Correspondingly, scholars analyzing clientelism and state formation habitually discuss the configuration of new forms of governance and the consolidation of state power without intersecting these processes with the production of vulnerabilities and “hazardous nature.” Drawing on ethnographic research in urban areas susceptible to serious floods and landslides in Brazil and Mexico, we argue that clientelist governance and state making, including complex forms of political favoritism, create urban hazardscapes, as much as the management of urban disasters acts to reconfigure patron–client relations within “hazardstates.” The article contributes to an emerging body of literature analyzing linkages between urban environmental governance, state authority, and the reproduction of vulnerability."
Tree Extraction from Airborne Laser Scanning Data in Urban Areas,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/321bf0a3a24f9bfee94800e9d307b4b990b79959,Han You; Shihua Li; Yifan Xu; Ze He; Di Wang,"Tree information in urban areas plays a significant role in many fields of study, such as ecology and environmental management. Airborne LiDAR scanning (ALS) excels at the fast and efficient acquisition of spatial information in urban-scale areas. Tree extraction from ALS data is an essential part of tree structural studies. Current raster-based methods that use canopy height models (CHMs) suffer from the loss of 3D structure information, whereas the existing point-based methods are non-robust in complex environments. Aiming at making full use of the canopy’s 3D structure information that is provided by point cloud data, and ensuring the method’s suitability in complex scenes, this paper proposes a new point-based method for tree extraction that is based on 3D morphological features. Considering the elevation deviations of the ALS data, we propose a neighborhood search method to filter out the ground and flat-roof points. A coarse extraction method, combining planar projection with a point density-filtering algorithm is applied to filter out distracting objects, such as utility poles and cars. After that, a Euclidean cluster extraction (ECE) algorithm is used as an optimization strategy for coarse extraction. In order to verify the robustness and accuracy of the method, airborne LiDAR data from Zhangye, Gansu, China and unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) LiDAR data from Xinyang, Henan, China were tested in this study. The experimental results demonstrated that our method was suitable for extracting trees in complex urban scenes with either high or low point densities. The extraction accuracy obtained for the airborne LiDAR data and UAV LiDAR data were 99.4% and 99.2%, respectively. In addition, a further study found that the aberrant vertical structure of the artificially pruned canopy was the main cause of the error. Our method achieved desirable results in different scenes, with only one adjustable parameter, making it an easy-to-use method for urban area studies."

One of the most crucial elements of a successful land resource management plan is the evaluation of Land Use Land Cover (LULC). Over the past 20 years, our planet's land cover resources have undergone substantial changes due to rapid development. The Land Use Land Cover (LULC) categories of the Patna Urban Agglomeration (PUA), including water bodies, agricultural land, barren land, built-up areas, and vegetation, were identified using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. Three multi-temporal images were analyzed and classified through supervised classification using the maximum likelihood method. By comparing three separately created LULC categorized maps from 1990 and 2024, temporal changes were analyzed. In order to update land cover or manage natural resources, it is vital to use change detection as a tool to identify changes in LULC over time in PUA, Patna between 1990, 2010 and 2024. According to their respective Kappa coefficients, the accuracy rates for 1990, 2010 and 2024 LULC are 91.66 and 94.93, respectively. An accuracy evaluation was conducted to determine the correctness of the classification system and to determine the efficacy of the LULC classification maps. One hundred reference test pixels were identified. There have been found significant changes in the LULC were built up area has increased doubled in last thirty-four years of timeline."
Fine Classification of Urban Tree Species Based on UAV-Based RGB Imagery and LiDAR Data,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/323569f750a40de0c7b7f3a36732a185f1fb8e23,Jingru Wu; Qixia Man; Xinming Yang; Pinliang Dong; Xiaotong Ma; Chunhui Liu; Changyin Han,"Rapid and accurate classification of urban tree species is crucial for the protection and management of urban ecology. However, tree species classification remains a great challenge because of the high spatial heterogeneity and biodiversity. Addressing this challenge, in this study, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based high-resolution RGB imagery and LiDAR data were utilized to extract seven types of features, including RGB spectral features, texture features, vegetation indexes, HSV spectral features, HSV texture features, height feature, and intensity feature. Seven experiments involving different feature combinations were conducted to classify 10 dominant tree species in urban areas with a Random Forest classifier. Additionally, Plurality Filling was applied to further enhance the accuracy of the results as a post-processing method. The aim was to explore the potential of UAV-based RGB imagery and LiDAR data for tree species classification in urban areas, as well as evaluate the effectiveness of the post-processing method. The results indicated that, compared to using RGB imagery alone, the integrated LiDAR and RGB data could improve the overall accuracy and the Kappa coefficient by 18.49% and 0.22, respectively. Notably, among the features based on RGB, the HSV and its texture features contribute most to the improvement of accuracy. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the optimal feature combination could achieve 73.74% and 0.70 with the Random Forest classifier, respectively. Additionally, the Plurality Filling method could increase the overall accuracy by 11.76%, which could reach 85.5%. The results of this study confirm the effectiveness of RGB imagery and LiDAR data for urban tree species classification. Consequently, these results could provide a valuable reference for the precise classification of tree species using UAV remote sensing data in urban areas."
Area Neutrality: safeguarding urban biodiversity with a new land management framework in Trondheim,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32420b1abbc3a0c8e6a4ace2fb123c89c5087953,AA McCormack; LM Foldnes Lunde; JL McDowell; A. Iqbal; S. Ojee; A. Nowokreschenow,"Area neutrality is a municipal land use management system that prioritizes the protection of nature in urban development. This framework calls for first avoiding nature destruction, then reducing nature loss, and finally “replacing” natural lands that are developed for human use by restoring other areas. In effect, it extends the net-zero philosophy to the loss of nature. In this exploratory study, we consider the effects of implementing area neutrality in the municipal planning of Trondheim, Norway. The potential benefits of the framework are considered in terms of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. Principles of urban ecology are applied to the framework so that positive ecological impacts are maximized. We conclude with a SWOT analysis of area neutrality in general and consideration of challenges for Trondheim Municipality specifically. This study provides an overview of a system which could be highly beneficial to both the urban and natural ecosystems of Trondheim and other areas if implemented responsibly."

Understanding mosquito diversity, ecology and biting behaviour in urban areas is crucial for effective control. This study assessed Anopheles diversity, abundance, behaviour, and Plasmodium infection rates in Kisumu city, Kenya. Methods Indoor and outdoor host-seeking and resting adult mosquitoes were collected using CDC miniature light traps (CDC-LT) and Prokopack aspirators along an urban–rural transect. Anophelines were identified morphologically, with Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) and Anopheles funestus group further distinguished to siblings using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sporozoite infection rates were determined using a multiplexed real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. Results A total of 3,394 female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected: An. gambiae s.l. (68%), An. funestus s.l. (19.8%), Anopheles coustani (7.8%), Anopheles pharoensis (2.6%), Anopheles maculipalipis (1.6%), and Anopheles leesoni (0.2%). All six species were found in urban zone, but only three were in peri-urban and rural sites. Overall, urban collection accounted for 55.5% of mosquitoes, followed by peri-urban (30%) and rural sites (14.5%). Anopheles arabiensis dominated urban (84.3%) and peri-urban (89%) sites, while An. gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) was predominant in rural zone (60.2%) alongside An. arabiensis (39.7%). Anopheles funestus was predominant in peri-urban (98.4%) and rural (85.7%) areas, while An. leesoni accounted for 1.6% and 14.3%, respectively. In urban areas, all An. funestus s.l. samples were An. funestus s.s.. Most (55.5%) of Anopheles mosquitoes were collected indoors, while secondary vectors were mainly outdoors. Overall, sporozoite rates were higher outdoors (3.5%) than indoors (1.45%) in rural areas. Indoor rates were 2.5% (An. funestus), 1.4% (An. gambiae s.s.), and 1% (An. arabiensis). Outdoors, An. gambiae had 5.3%, and An. arabiensis 2.1%. In peri-urban areas, An. gambiae had 2.3%. No sporozoites were found in urban samples. Conclusion The study highlights a shift in Anopheles diversity towards urban areas with increased outdoor activity and outdoor malaria transmission in rural and peri-urban areas, underscoring the need for tools targeting outdoor-biting mosquitoes. The presence of An. funestus in urban settings emphasizes the need for sustained entomological surveillance to inform integrated vector control."
Tools for prioritizing Ecosystem Services provided by fragments forest in the context of cities,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3259cd0431b32a1374175e546c4662e3e4677fa9,Alessandra Leite da Silva; A. Ribeiro; R. Longo,"Abstract Forest remnants are essential in the provision of ecosystem services in cities. However, adequate ecological parameters are still needed to assess them. Because of this, the present work proposes a methodology for assessing the potential of providing ecosystem services by forest remnants in urban watershed based on the application and interpretation of landscape spatial metrics used in Landscape Ecology studies. For that, the environmental indicators (area, central area, circularity index, distance from the nearest neighbor, water springs, land use, and occupation in the surroundings) were evaluated in GIS software and to them, the Hierarchical Process Analysis Method (AHP) was applied to identify the importance of each parameter in the provision of ecosystem services and the priority in each remainder. The study was carried out in a watershed in Campinas/ SP, in which it was found that forest remnants develop, primarily, ecosystem support or habitat services, regulation services, and cultural services."

During the 2015-2016 El-Niño event, we have conducted an analysis on the diversity of living roadside herbs in a green landscape of Western Java from Universitas Indonesia. The result of the study revealed that a high percentage of non-native species (41.67%) in a roadside ecosystem during the El-Niño event. Axonopus compressus which is an alien species is the most important species based on its importance value index with 74.01%. This condition, together with the high percentage of non-native species show the resistance of those group in its new environment outside their native range even in one of the driest period. It also shows the possibility of such a group to become persist if the habitat of the native species affected by temperature increases, such as climate change."
Urban Impervious Surface Extraction Using Seasonal Time Series SAR Images,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/326684be0e6b95444c9b58daf948d0552aaa9a6b,W. Wu; Z. Shao; Jiahua Teng; Xiao Huang; Xinwei Zhao; Songjing Guo,"Urban impervious surface (UIS) is an essential indicator to measure urban ecology, and understanding its temporal and spatial distribution is of great significance for alleviating urban diseases, such as heat island. Although remote sensing techniques have been widely used to extract UIS, the capability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology in UIS extraction has not been thoroughly investigated. Accordingly, this article systematically analyzed the role of the backscattering and interferometric coherence features of dual polarized (VH/VV) SAR in UIS extraction, taking Tianjin city, China, as a study case. Specifically, we used seasonal time series Sentinel-1B backscattering and coherence images to extract UIS via two object-based classifiers. We further investigated the seasonal, polarization, and precipitation effects on UIS extraction using SAR images. Our findings suggested that, for coherence images, the extraction accuracy of UIS in summer is the highest, while for backscattering that in spring and winter are the highest. Our results also suggested that VH polarization is more suitable for UIS extraction compared with VV polarization. These findings of this study confirmed the utility and effectiveness of time series SAR backscattering and coherence images in UIS extraction, providing an essential reference for UIS extraction in other places with a similar climate. We encourage more efforts to be made toward UIS extraction using SAR images and toward designing a filling scheme for the UIS extraction in a continuous manner, especially in cloudy and rainy areas."
Hypotheses in urban ecology: building a common knowledge base,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32679d4a91e4ea5836aee699921397911c14e99f,S. Lokatis; J. Jeschke; Maud Bernard‐Verdier; S.

Straka; Tina Heger,"Urban ecology is a rapidly growing research field that has to keep pace with the pressing need to tackle the sustainability crisis. As an inherently multi‐disciplinary field with close ties to practitioners and administrators, research synthesis and knowledge transfer between those different stakeholders is crucial. Knowledge maps can enhance knowledge transfer and provide orientation to researchers as well as practitioners. A promising option for developing such knowledge maps is to create hypothesis networks, which structure existing hypotheses and aggregate them according to topics and research aims. Combining expert knowledge with information from the literature, we here identify 62 research hypotheses used in urban ecology and link them in such a network. Our network clusters hypotheses into four distinct themes: (i) Urban species traits & evolution, (ii) Urban biotic communities, (iii) Urban habitats and (iv) Urban ecosystems. We discuss the potentials and limitations of this approach. All information is openly provided as part of an extendable Wikidata project, and we invite researchers, practitioners and others interested in urban ecology to contribute additional hypotheses, as well as comment and add to the existing ones. The hypothesis network and Wikidata project form a first step towards a knowledge base for urban ecology, which can be expanded and curated to benefit both practitioners and researchers."

Cultivating Urban Storytellers: A Radical Co-Creation to Enact Cognitive Justice for/in Self-Built Neighbourhoods,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/327923dbaabea5b2f8486eafeb416191a2ec426c,C. Ortiz,"We all carry an imperative to imagining collectively more just cities, to engaging more meaningfully with multiple urban actors and their different sensibilities through their stories. Storytelling helps to foster empathy, to understand the meaning of complex experiences, and, most importantly, to inspire action. With the rise of the digital era and new technologies at hand, we have an opportunity to redefine not only the way we tell, connect, and engage with our collective stories, but also how we work together in forming them. Based on the research design project Patrimonio Vivo | Living Heritage, grounded in the city of Medellín, this article illustrates the dynamics and potentials of co-creation with cultural organizations and creative teams through learning alliances. Our alliance among a cultural community centre, a cooperative of architects, a grassroot organisation and post-graduate students around the world used storytelling to propel an ecology of urban knowledges. Working online during the global lockdown, we mobilised stories of solidarity, care, memory, and livelihoods through the narrative of people, places, and organisations following their trajectories as the basis for the design of spatial strategies. This collaborative work aimed at contributing to the recognition of everyday spatial practices in self-built neighbourhoods as a form of “living heritage” of the city and a key building block for reframing a more progressive “integral neighbourhood upgrading” practice. I argue that using storytelling as a co-creative methodology, based on learning alliances, we can bridge the ecology of urban knowledges to foster cognitive justice and transform the current stigmatizing urban narrative of self-built neighbourhoods."

 How do place and social context shape how policymakers construct the targets of state interventions? This paper analyzes recent proposals in California to subject people experiencing homelessness to involuntary psychiatric treatment. Using newspaper articles, legislative hearings, government reports, and interviews, we show how policymakers frame “the homeless mentally ill” in distinctive ways: Chronic and contained people who require extended institutionalization, disruptive and visible individuals who need a period of forced sobriety, and a service-resisting and underserved population whom mental health agencies have overlooked, but who could comply with treatment with a coercive incentive. We argue these constructions reflect how policymakers represent specific target ecologies: concentrated but confined homelessness on LA’s Skid Row, frequent and expensive use of emergency services in San Francisco’s Tenderloin, and expanding homelessness in jurisdictions traditionally reticent to provide care, as in San Diego County. This paper shows the value of disaggregating broad population categories to show how they are differentially problematized, as policymakers seek to gain support and justify intervention in specific places. We also illustrate a broader policy trend of reframing involuntary treatment as a progressive and compassionate response to substance use, homelessness, and urban disorder."

Music should play an important role in achieving the goals of sustainable development, rather than be a utilitarian product of consumer society. Therefore, attention should be drawn to the music teacher education and to a new paradigm of education that is ecology-focused, aesthetic, and enables sustainable development at the urban, suburban, and rural levels. The study examines issues around the ecology-focused aesthetic music education in the context of sustainable development culture. This study aimed to substantiate an integration framework for ecological rationality, aesthetic education, and musical ecology in order to build a new educational paradigm from international experience. This is a review of the survey findings reported by the Country Music Association Foundation. The survey involved 468 music teachers from 392 primary, secondary and high schools in the United States. The weighting procedure used ensured that the sample of responding schools was nationally representative along the two dimensions of school locale/urbanicity (e.g. urban, suburban, town/exurbun, rural) and the grade levels (e.g. primary, middle, high, or some combination). The contemporary approach to education should be improved to extend ecological and integrated methods and ideas of thinking and hence bring the art of music to a new horizon with a higher goal of creating a sustainable community of ecologically responsible individuals. This study offered an integration model for ecological rationality, aesthetic education, and musical ecology in order to build a new educational paradigm. The proposal represents a framework that is built around five components of society, ecological rationality, teachers, sustainable development, and musical ecology."

Abstract The Directive on Energy Efficiency of Buildings 2010/31 / EU (EPBD) was amended by Directive 2018/844 of the European Parliament to, among other things, accelerate the deep renovation of buildings in the European Union (EU). According to this update, Member States should create a clear path towards achieving a zero-emission building stock in the EU by 2050 supported by national roadmaps with national milestones and indicators of progress, and by public funding and investment and private. It is clear t the European Commission's priority to achieve the true decarbonisation of cities must be, in addition to limiting emissions from new buildings, to energetically renovation of existing buildings. Spain has a long-term Strategy for energy rehabilitation in the building sector in Spain that has been valued as the best strategy in the entire European Union. This strategy is qualitative in nature, and it is interesting to provide it with quantifiable data based on the objectives already achieved that allow the articulation of clear and effective policies. This communication aims to present the results of the Evaluation Report on public policies for residential renovation in Spain (2013-2017) resulting from the Research Project ""sustainable use of natural resources"" funded by the Ministry for Ecological Transition (MITECO) in the call 2018. This report has made it possible to provide quantifiable values for the energy savings and emissions achieved in the period studied. A research methodology has been developed for the monitoring and evaluation of public policies and private initiatives about urban regeneration and renovation, indicators have been developed and future recommendations have been made to help measure the objectives and results, particularly regarding energy saving. The results show the lack of measure by public administrations and show that we are far from the objectives. This study has been carried out by the Observatorio Ciudad 3R –Renovation. Renewal.

The paper presents an algorithm for analyzing urban planning conflicts. The material for the study was data from social networks, microblogging, blogs, instant messaging, forums, reviews, video hosting services, thematic portals, online media, print media and TV related to the construction of the North-Eastern Chord (NEC) in Moscow (RF). To analyze the content of social media, a multimodal approach was used. The paper presents the results of research on the development of methods and approaches for constructing mathematical and neural network models for analyzing the social media users’ perceptions based on their digital footprints. Artificial neural networks, differential equations, and mathematical statistics were involved in building the models. Differential equations of dynamic systems were based on observations enabled by machine learning. Mathematical models were developed to quickly detect, prevent, and address conflicts in urban planning in order to manage urban systems efficiently. In combination with mathematical and neural network model the developed approaches, made it possible to draw a conclusion about the tense situation around the construction of the NEC, identify complaints of residents to constructors and city authorities, and propose recommendations to resolve and prevent conflicts. Research data could be of use in solving similar problems in sociology, ecology, and economics."

We draw on extensive fieldwork from 2012 to 2016, and diverge from previous studies on offsetting by focusing less on issues related to metrics and governance and shifting our analytic attention to the economic and urban geographies surrounding the Lodge Hill case. We argue that this approach can offer not only an empirically grounded account of why offsetting is being selected to address the impacts of specific urban development projects, but also an in-depth understanding of the factors that determine offsetting’s actual implementation on the ground. Viewing the Lodge Hill case through the frame of urbanization allows us to better grasp the how, why and when particular alliances of actors contest and/or support the implementation of biodiversity offsetting. Our analytical lens also helps exposing the fragility of neoliberal natures and the roles inter-capitalist competition and species biology and ecology can play on the success or failure of neoliberal policies."

Дегтярева,"В статье рассматривается концепция реализации умного города с практической точки зрения на примере Сибирского федерального округа (СФО). Ключевым направлением концепции является организация комфортной среды для населения, которая может быть выражена в уменьшении антропогенной нагрузки на экологию города, в контроле за размещением и утилизацией отходов производства и потребления. Внедрение цифровых решений в городскую и коммунальную инфраструктуры возможно при согласованных действиях государства и частного бизнеса. Необходимость создания единых городских баз данных по площадкам хранения твердых коммунальных отходов (ТКО) обусловлена ежегодным ростом объемов отходов производства и потребления во всех регионах СФО. Для решения проблемы перезагруженности мусорных полигонов в регионах предлагается использование методов лазерного сканирования, создающих объекты с большой плотностью точек. Эти методы позволяют дистанционно наблюдать за состоянием площади объектов размещения отходов. В качестве действующего инструмента регулирования объемов перемещаемого мусора возможна установка беспроводной системы LoRaWan. Это позволит оптимизировать размер платежей региональным операторам за транспортировку и утилизацию ТКО. В статье предложена модель управления умной средой, включающая ряд измеряемых переменных: численность населения, проживающего на территории, размер тарифов на вывоз мусора, затраты региональных операторов на вывоз, транспортировку и утилизацию отходов различных классов опасности, величина штрафных санкций за несанкционированное размещение ТКО, количество полигонов, предназначенных для захоронения, их фактическая площадь, объем образованных, утилизированных и обезвреженных отходов производства и потребления. Данная модель даст возможность измерять и прогнозировать изменение качества окружающей среды крупных городских агломераций.
 The article discusses the concept of implementing a smart city from a practical point of view on the example of the Siberian Federal District (SFD). The key direction of the concept is the organization of a comfortable environment for the population, which can be expressed in reducing the anthropogenic load on the city’s ecology, in controlling the placement and disposal of production and consumption waste. The implementation of digital solutions in urban and municipal infrastructure is possible with the coordinated actions of the state and private business. The need to create unified urban databases on municipal solid waste (MSW) storage sites is due to the annual growth in the volume of production and consumption waste in all regions of the SFD. To solve the problem of reloading landfills in the regions, it is proposed to use laser scanning methods that create objects with a high density of points. These methods allow you to remotely monitor the status of the area of the waste disposal facilities. The LoRaWan wireless system can be installed as an effective tool for regulating the volume of garbage being moved. This will optimize the amount of payments to regional operators for the transportation and disposal of MSW. The article proposes a smart environment management model that includes a number of measurable variables: the number of people living on the territory, the amount of tariffs for garbage removal, the costs of regional operators for the removal, transportation and disposal of waste of various hazard classes, the amount of penalties for unauthorized placement of MSW, the number of landfills intended for burial, their actual area, the volume of generated, disposed and neutralized production and consumption waste. This model will make it possible to measure and predict changes in the environmental quality of large urban agglomerations."
Wild bee larval food composition in five European cities,2022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3319e736d0a6692291724c51fda493e094fc6916,J. Casanelles‐Abella; A. Keller; S.

Moretti,"Abstract Urbanization poses threats and opportunities for the biodiversity of wild bees. At the same time, cities can harbor diverse wild bee assemblages, partly due to the unique plant assemblages that provide resources. While bee dietary preferences have been investigated in various studies, bee dietary studies have been conducted mostly in nonurban ecosystems and data based on plant visitation observations or palynological techniques. This data set describes the larval food preferences of four wild bee species (i.e., Chelostoma florisomne, Hylaeus communis, Osmia bicornis, and O. cornuta) common in urban areas in five different European cities (i.e., Antwerp, Belgium; Paris, France; Poznan, Poland; Tartu, Estonia; and Zurich, Switzerland). In addition, the data set describes the larval food preferences of individuals from three wild bee genera (i.e., Chelostoma sp., Hylaeus sp., and Osmia sp.) that could not be identified to the species level. These data were obtained from a Europe‐level study aimed at understanding the effects of urbanization on biodiversity across different cities and cityscapes and a Swiss project aimed at understanding the effects of urban ecosystems in wild bee feeding behavior. Wild bees were sampled using standardized trap nests at 80 sites (32 in Zurich and 12 in each of the remaining cities), selected following a double gradient of available habitat at local and landscape scales. Larval pollen was obtained from the bee nests and identified using DNA metabarcoding. The data provide the plant composition at the species or genus level preferred by each bee. These unique data can be used for a wide array of research questions, including urban ecology (e.g., diversity of food sources along urban gradients), bee ecology (characterization of bee feeding preferences), or comparative studies on the urban evolution of behavioral traits between urban and nonurban sites. In addition, the data can be used to inform urban planning and conservation strategies, particularly concerning flower resources (e.g., importance of exotic species and, thus, management activities). This data set can be freely used for noncommercial purposes, and this data paper should be cited if the data is used; we request that collaboration with the data set contact person to be considered if this data set represents an important part of the data analyzed in a study."

Urban Environmental Planning in Shimla Smart City: Review of Related Literature,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/33422fb535c503fb8d9d1bead14bbdeed589448e,Devendra KUMAR PIRTA,"Urban environmental concerns are on rise due to increasing population pressure on finite natural resources, deforestation, over grazing, unplanned construction, networking of roads and large-scale modification of natural landscape. It has caused irreversible damage to the ecology of this Himalayan state. Number of ultra modern projects, road networking, hydropower projects, and SEZ and real estate projects are costing Himalayan ecology. Unplanned developmental activities and urban processes in city have resulted in several ecological problems like environmental pollution, noise pollution extreme climatic conditions, shortage of drinking water, landslides, sinking land and change in seasonal cycle. Poor urban planning will cause social, economic and environmental implications in long term. Cities needs to be planned professionally keeping in mind future sustainability. Before planning a city in hilly areas, needs proper understanding of complex and dynamic phenomena involving interaction between environmental and socio- economic and political factors with multi disciplinary approach and vision. Urbanization and industrialization on one side is contributing its share in economic development of a region but on the other hand, it is degenerating water, air, soil and natural resources resulting in the degradation of environmental quality (Anjum, 1998). Urban environmental degradation leaves direct impact on the ecology and causes ecological imbalance (Singh, 1996). The most striking reason for the environmental degradation is the changing man and environment relationship. (Dasman, 1976), Shah (2001). Developmental activities in Himalayan region need different treatment and systematic planning."
Pollinators and Pollination,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3346a54b87039798d3a23cf9ff5771c6af16aa5a,J. Ollerton,"A unique and personal insight into the ecology and evolution of pollinators, their relationships with flowers, and their conservation in a rapidly changing world. The pollination of flowers by insects, birds and other animals is a fundamentally important ecological function that supports both the natural world and human society. Without pollinators to facilitate the sexual reproduction of plants, the world would be a biologically poorer place in which to live, there would be an impact on food security, and human health would suffer. Written by one of the world’s leading pollination ecologists, this book provides an introduction to what pollinators are, how their interactions with flowers have evolved, and the fundamental ecology of these relationships. It explores the pollination of wild and agricultural plants in a variety of habitats and contexts, including urban, rural and agricultural environments. The author also provides practical advice on how individuals and organisations can study, and support, pollinators. As well as covering the natural history of pollinators and flowers, the author discusses their cultural importance, and the ways in which pollinator conservation has been portrayed from a political perspective. The book draws on field work experiences in South America, Africa, Australia, the Canary Islands and the UK. For over 30 years the author has spent his career researching how plants and pollinators evolve relationships, how these interactions function ecologically, their importance for society, and how we can conserve them in a rapidly changing world. This book offers a unique and personal insight into the science of pollinators and pollination, aimed at anyone who is interested in understanding these fascinating and crucial ecological interactions."
The Application of Marine Landscape Based on Financing Model in Modern Landscape Design,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3350ae14933731fc31e8af8c6c281e886eca0e5b,Xinhui Meng; Junliu Song; Chunfeng Wan,"ABSTRACT Meng, X.; Song, J., and Wan, C., 2020. The application of marine landscape based on financing model in modern landscape design. In: Li, L. and Huang, X. (eds.), Sustainable Development in Coastal Regions: A Perspective of Environment, Economy, and Technology. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 112, pp. 36-39. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. As early as in 2017, the concept of “clear water and green mountains are gold and silver mountains” put forward by General Secretary Xi Jinping has become an important concept guiding China's urban landscape planning. In urban landscape planning, first - and biennial grass flowers are one of the important plant materials in urban greening. Grass flower landscape can not only enhance the effect of land cover, highlight the value and characteristics of herbaceous flowers in landscaping. At the same time, the sustainable development of urban landscape planning is not only reflected in the tangible business products, on the activities of planning and preparation also should pay attention to ecological environment, not blind pursuit of economic efficiency, and coordination of landscape ecology and environment, the relationship between development and resources to build, make the landscape design of the Marine landscape more meaningful."
Wise City as an accessible city. Directions of positive changes in Poland on the example of academic campus at the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice,2021,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3353155f3c58f4ab51a3f59cdc04fb717fb5f6a8,K. Ujma-Wąsowicz,"The development of any community is inextricably linked with the space in which a community functions. Neuroscience research reveal that the most negative emotions in social coexistence are triggered by exclusion, including inability to participate in public life due to architectural accessibility barriers. This means that without implementation of inclusive and pro-social space assumption, the negative, constantly functioning in numerous places state will not be changed. In Poland, a law on “ensuring accessibility for people with special needs” was enacted in July 2019, forcing administrators of public money to take measures to ensure that all facilities under their authority are adapted to the limitations and needs of users with varying degrees of disability. Due to this reason, among others, an action for widely understood accessibility was undertaken by the Silesian University of Technology. The realisation of this task overlaps with the idea of the ""Wise City"", which has recently been gaining increasing social acceptance and which aims to balance the influence of smart technology on urban planning and architecture through its coexistence with ecology and human potential. The aim of this paper is to present, on the example of a small public space in Gliwice belonging to the Silesian University of Technology, the planned and to some extent already implemented positive solutions not only in terms of eliminating architectural accessibility barriers but also in terms of implementing new, innovative on a Polish scale solutions for city accessibility such as navigation and information system for the blind compatible with tactile maps."
Body condition and poxvirus infection predict circulating glucose levels in a colorful songbird that inhabits urban and rural environments.,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/33556b88b9dd0e948ae8c49e2bf885409451b0b3,K. McGraw; K. Chou; A. Bridge; Hannah C McGraw; Peyton R McGraw; Richard K. Simpson,"There is widespread contemporary interest in causes and consequences of blood glucose status in humans (e.g., links to diabetes and cardiovascular disease), but we know comparatively less about what underlies variation in glucose levels of wild animals. Several environmental factors, including diet, disease status, and habitat quality, may regulate glucose circulation, and we are in need of work that assesses many organismal traits simultaneously to understand the plasticity and predictability of glucose levels in ecological and evolutionary contexts. Here, we measured circulating glucose levels in a species of passerine bird (the house finch, Haemorhous mexicanus) that has served as a valuable model for research on sexual selection, disease, and urban behavioral ecology, as these animals display sexually dichromatic ornamental coloration, harbor many infectious diseases (e.g., poxvirus, coccidiosis, mycoplasmal conjunctivitis), and reside in both natural habitats and cities. We tested the effects of sex, habitat type, body condition, coccidiosis and poxvirus infections, and expression of carotenoid plumage coloration on blood glucose concentrations and found that the body condition and poxvirus infection significantly predicted circulating glucose levels. Specifically, birds with higher blood glucose levels had higher body condition scores and were infected with poxvirus. This result is consistent with biomedical, domesticated-animal, and wildlife-rehabilitation findings, and the premise that glucose elevation is a physiological response to or indicator of infection and relative body weight. The fact that we failed to find links between glucose and our other measurements suggests that blood glucose levels can reveal some but not all aspects of organismal or environmental quality."
Landscape Restoration Design of Guilin Lijiang River Basin Based on” City Betterment and Ecological Restoration”,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/335bd19c0c466b0022feefe2e53b44a3c6030875,Weiran Tian; Ying Huang,"As an important carrier of urban ecology, urban river channels have serious ecological problems that restrict the development of cities. Taking Lijiang River in Guilin as the research object, the field survey of the water system shape, water quality status, plant landscape and other aspects of the Lijiang River Basin was conducted to analyse its existing ecological problems. Based on the concept of “City Betterment and Ecological Restoration”, the Lijiang River Basin ecological restoration and landscape repair work will be carried out from four aspects: water quality management, construction of natural river shape, coastal vegetation landscape ecological restoration, and water system landscape optimization design, so as to achieve a virtuous cycle of water ecosystem and promote sustainable development of landscape in Lijiang River Basin."
Urban green spaces of İstanbul: from ‘beautifying’ efforts to ‘mega-projects’,2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3364791c11120da881cfb4cb0ab069ae7f1c5771,Esra Sert,"ABSTRACT This study discusses the transformation of urban green spaces in İstanbul, focusing specifically on gardens, groves, parks, and the Northern Forests. Recent research has underscored a significant loss of green space during the 2000s, posing a threat to biodiversity and essential ecosystem services. Despite maintaining a socio-natural continuum, it is evident that the twenty-first century represents a significant departure from the past. This study identifies two pivotal periods: the ‘beautification’ efforts undertaken the young republican period and the ‘mega-projects’ of the 2000s. These periods exhibit both similarities and substantial differences in politics and spatial organization concerning the urbanization of nature. The concept of urban political ecology is incorporated here, which advocates for equal socio-natural solutions and highlights the interconnectedness between urban areas and nature. The study concludes by emphasizing the need to continue examining the winners and losers in transformation of urban green spaces and move beyond project-driven development. It contributes modestly to the growing literature by shedding light on how historically and spatially organized ecologies of urban green spaces in the context of İstanbul can help us understand the socio-spatial changes we are witnessing today, characterized by the extended urbanization of nature worldwide."

Keeping up with the agroecology movement: priorities for agroecology and sustainable food systems,2020,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/336f925cb4287bbce36001e3d7a3d24f5a7f36c3,S. Gliessman; B. Ferguson,"As we begin a new volume year for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (ASFS), we want to share with our readers, reviewers, and contributors some thoughts about the future of our journal. Thanks to a remarkable growth in interest in agroecology, we are receiving more manuscripts than ever before. As authors have developed more awareness of what constitutes good research in agroecology, the percentage of articles that might qualify for ASFS has also gone up. This puts us in the unhappy position of having to exclude some really good papers from the journal, but also allows us to select for innovative work that contributes to agroecosystem redesign using ecological principles, as well as food system transformation based on agroecological production, equity, participation, democracy, and social justice (agroecology at Levels 3–5 in the transition process as described in our editorial in Volume 40 Issue 3) (Gliessman 2016). This kind of work embraces the complexity of farms and food systems, and increasingly is transdisciplinary, conducted in collaboration with farmers and other food system actors, and change oriented. Agroecology has become much more than new or improved farming practices and on-farm sustainable management of natural resources. It is the ecology of the entire food system, from the farm field to the meal table, from the people who grow and process our food to the people who consume it, from urban to rural, from farm policy to food policy, and from local to global. As defined in our editorial in Volume 42 Issue 6 (Gliessman 2018), agroecology is a broad field that must integrate science, practice, and the movements leading to social change in all parts of the food system. We need examples of how such change is happening. With this in mind, we will no longer be looking for submissions to the journal that focus primarily on improving conventional practices (transition Level 1). Such research can find homes in agronomic journals. We will also no longer consider research that is focused solely on the substitution of conventional inputs with alternatives (transition Level 2), such as organic amendments, since there are many journals that focus on the practices of organic and alternative agriculture. This will allow us instead to focus on transition Levels 3–5 where redesigning food systems takes priority (Level 3), on relationship-based and alternative markets that strengthen equity and solidarity among food system participants (Level 4), and on the deep transformative change needed in all parts of the food system to achieve ecological, economic, social, and cultural sustainability (Level 5). This includes interand transdisciplinary case studies of farm and foodsystem transformation that address thin spots in the literature but may not find a home in journals with a less holistic focus. We no longer consider papers that are based primarily on surveys, modeling, laboratory or experiment station research, or research on sustainability indicators or species distributions that is not participatory and provides some novel insight regarding agroecological transformation beyond the particular system studied. We publish reviews and meta-analysis papers only when they offer novel synthesis that supports agroecological transformation at levels 3–5.

VECTOR OF “GREEN CONSTRUCTION” IN MODERN CITIES,2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/33769dbb6c863b658db7f25c4adfb9f9077ce242,E. Akhmedova; A. Fillali,"The article deals with the history of the formation of the scientific direction of urban ecology in the context of the development of domestic urban planning science. The relevance is substantiated by the global processes of the struggle for energy resources, the deterioration of the environment, an increase in the volume of municipal solid waste and an increase in carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere as a result of the use of hydrocarbon energy sources, and other negative processes accompanying the spread of urbanization and industrial production around the world. The development of technologies for ""green"" urban planning is analyzed in connection with scientific research on the sustainability of regional landscapes to anthropogenic loads and increased requirements for the compensatory properties of landscape frames in the largest cities. Both the concepts of smart cities of the future and measures to gradually improve the quality of the environment in established cities both in Russia and abroad are considered, including with the help of targeted programs ""Green City,"" Green Quarter ""and others. The study of these trends seems to be an important scientific problem for the formation of a consistently positive regional environment in terms of the topics of promising research in universities."
